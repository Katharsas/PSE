Story highlights
Bill and Melinda Gates,asked by students what superpowers they would like to have, picked more energy and more time
They say the world needs more energy, particularly clean energy, to empower the poor and deal with climate change
Women around the world need more time, and are generally expected to do much more unpaid work than men, authors say
The authors are co-chairs of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Their 2016 Annual Letter, from which this article was adapted, is available at www.gatesletter.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs.
(CNN)
If you could have one superpower, what would it be?
We were asked that question recently by high school students in Kentucky. Our answers must have sounded pretty lame to fans of superheroes like Supergirl and the Flash -- we simply wished for more energy and time to help us keep up with all the moving pieces in our busy lives.
Bill Gates
But for billions of families around the world, the challenges of energy and time are very different from ours -- and these challenges have a huge impact on their ability to realize their potential. That's why we chose to focus on these critical issues in our annual letter, which we're releasing today.
Melinda Gates
Energy to fuel poverty reduction
Imagine life without energy. No energy to power a light bulb, mobile phone, or fridge. In fact, about 1.3 billion people -- 18% of the world's population -- don't need to imagine. That's what life is like for them every day.

If we had to sum up history in one sentence it would be: "Life gets better -- not for everyone all the time, but for most people most of the time." And one of the biggest reasons is energy. For thousands of years, people burned wood for fuel. Their lives were, by and large, short and hard.
But when people started using coal in the 1800s, life started getting better a lot faster. Pretty soon we had lights, skyscrapers, elevators, air conditioning, cars, planes, and all the other things that make up modern life.
