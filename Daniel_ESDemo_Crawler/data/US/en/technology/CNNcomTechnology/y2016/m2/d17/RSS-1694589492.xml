<ExtractedText>China is no stranger to massive relocations for public projects. Some 1.2 million people were resettled to make way for the Three Gorges Dam.
Game-changer?
The telescope -- when completed the dish itself will be the size of 30 football pitches -- has the potential to be a game-changer for our understanding of the universe, and our search for life on other planets.
When it is finished it will potentially be able to detect radio signals -- and potentially, signs of life -- from planets orbiting a million stars and solar systems.

China has released hundreds of high-resolution photos taken by its Chang'e-3 lunar lander and rover. The rover, known as the "Jade Rabbit," is pictured here on the moon's surface.

The remoteness of the location -- meaning minimal interference from other radio signals -- and the region's topography make it an ideal site for a telescope of this kind.
When operational, it will surpass the current largest radio telescope, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which has a diameter of 305 meters.
Nan Rendong, chief scientist of the FAST project, told Xinhua last year that the huge dish will enable much more accurate detection.
"A radio telescope is like a sensitive ear, listening to tell meaningful radio messages from white noise in the universe. It is like identifying the sound of cicadas in a thunderstorm," he said.

Advancing astronomy
Its unprecedented precision will allow astronomers to survey the Milky Way and other galaxies and detect faint pulsars, and the array might also work as a powerful ground station for future space missions.
And, of course, it will advance the search for extraterrestrial signs of life.
In July 2015, when NASA discovered an 'earth-like' planet named Kepler-452b there was understandable excitement.
It was in the so-called 'Goldilocks zone' -- the right distance from its sun to support an atmosphere and liquid water.
But detecting radio signals -- signs of life -- from the planet is beyond the means of our current instruments. But not for FAST.
Wu Xiangping, director-general of the Chinese Astronomical Society, was bullish about its capabilities. "It will help us to search for intelligent life outside of the galaxy and explore the origins of the universe," he told state media
