<ExtractedText>Australian ship stuck in Antarctica refloated 01:22
Story highlights
37 expeditioners are taken by barge off the Aurora Australis, then by snow vehicle to Antarctica's Mawson station

The Aurora Australis has gone from grounded to floating off Antarctica, though dozens of expeditioners it had been carrying are no longer along for the ride.
The icebreaker -- which two years ago came to the rescue of dozens stranded on a Chinese ship -- itself got stuck Wednesday morning, when it broke from its moorings off Antarctica's Mawson station amid blizzard conditions. That set off intensive efforts to rescue the 68 aboard and get the vessel floating again.
On Thursday, the Australian government indicated both would occur "when the conditions ease."

Apparently, that's what happened Friday.
Despite it being the tail end of summer in Antarctica, sub-freezing temperatures persisted throughout the day, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology . Still, that's standard for the icy, polar continent: The fact that winds had died down considerably was much more significant for the rescue operations.

In light of that positive development, the 37 expeditioners on the Aurora Australis were the first to go.
All expeditioners have now been successfully transferred by barge from the Aurora Australis to Mawson station.
