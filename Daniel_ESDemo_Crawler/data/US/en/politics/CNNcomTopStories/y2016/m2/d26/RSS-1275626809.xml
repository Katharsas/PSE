Campaigning in Tehran has been fierce, with billboards and activists from both sides flocking to the streets. Some have even deemed the election as the most important nonpresidential race since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.

Many Iranian youths say life has improved under Rouhani, while conservatives express concerns about Western influence in the country. They accuse reformers of selling out to the West and have alleged foreign interference in the election. "Death to America" chants are still common.
Tehran's teens say Iran's not what you think it is
"We need to defeat the enemies of our country and always stay vigilant and stop infiltration from the West," a female voter told CNN on the eve of the vote.
A month before the election, many pro-reform candidates who might support Rouhani and his more moderate agenda were disqualified from participating. Thousands of candidates were blocked from running by an unelected, conservative 12-member group called the Guardian Council.
Human Rights Watch condemned the action: "Serious electoral flaws are restricting the rights of Iranians to run for office and damaging prospects for free and fair parliamentary elections," it said Wednesday.
Assembly of Experts and the Ayatollah
Friday's balloting is critical because voters will also determine the makeup of the Assembly of Experts, an oversight body responsible for selecting the Supreme Leader's successor.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is 76 years old and has been rumored to be ill. If he dies in the next eight years, the Assembly voted into power Friday will select the next supreme leader.
Khamenei publicly cast his ballot shortly after the polls opened in Tehran.
