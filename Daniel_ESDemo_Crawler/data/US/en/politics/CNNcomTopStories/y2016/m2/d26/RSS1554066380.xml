<ExtractedText>Divers discover underwater graveyard of extinct giants
In order to identify the best spots to set his cameras up Burrard-Lucas consulted Lise Hanssen, a conservationist who studies carnivores and works to find ways for human and animals to live together.
"The timing of my trip coincided with the dry season, so wherever you are the animals have to come up for water," Burrard-Lucas says.
"It was exciting to see so many different species by the watering hole, it was almost like a festive atmosphere," he adds.
To catch a predator
Lions proved to be the most elusive to catch -- in the three months Burrard-Lucas's camera traps were operating they were captured only twice.
"They were particularly challenging. They're very secretive and shy, but it was very satisfying to get images of them," says Burrard-Lucas.
How these ivory sniffer dogs can save elephants
The photographer also took videos to test if the animals were alarmed by the cameras, but says that they didn't seem to notice them. He explains this could be due to the fact he used a relatively low-powered flash which is comparable to beams of lightning, something animals would be familiar with.
Burrard-Lucas also steered clear of taking quick multiple shots to avoid the clicking noise, which could have alarmed the wildlife.

"Images have the power to connect a viewer with a subject in a way that is hard to achieve through written words and statistics," he says. "I hope that these images, in combination with WWF's efforts and Lise's valuable research, can help inspire conservation action in this important region," Burrard-Lucas adds.
