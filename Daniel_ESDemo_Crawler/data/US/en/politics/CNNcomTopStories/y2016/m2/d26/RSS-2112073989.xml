<ExtractedText>Ennio Morricone's philosophy on film music 01:35
Story highlights
Ennio Morricone is one of Hollywood's most acclaimed and continually daring composers
Nominated for an Academy Award for "The Hateful Eight" -- would be his first score to win
Has composed music for over 400 films including "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
London (CNN)
Eighty-seven-year-old maestro Ennio Morricone says it is only when audiences see the pictures on screen entwine with his music that he can finally be excited by what he has created.
The legendary Italian composer doesn't write music for awards juries, he says, but he admits he would be "very, very happy" if he was honored at last with a crowning Academy Award for Best Original Score.
Morricone -- best known internationally as the composer behind the instantly recognizable melodies that illuminate epochal Westerns "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "Once Upon a Time in the West" -- is nominated at the awards this Sunday 28 February. His music for Quentin Tarantino's "The Hateful Eight" provides his sixth nomination, but the Italian master has never won.
For many in the business -- he can count filmmakers Brian De Palma, Terrence Malick, Roman Polanski and Bernardo Bertolucci among his admirers -- this is one of the Academy's most egregious oversights.
Morricone, who is today unveiling a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, estimates he has written music for between 400 and 500 films. He reminds us that the Westerns he is best known for, account for only a small minority alongside cinematic classics including "The Untouchables" and "Cinema Paradiso."

Could Italian composer Ennio Morricone finally win the Oscar for Best Original Score?
The Rome-born composer arguably came closest to a win in 1986 when his original soundtrack for "The Mission" lost in controversial circumstances after critics argued his jazz arrangement predated the film. Morricone's score has since topped a Variety poll of the greatest soundtrack ever written.
