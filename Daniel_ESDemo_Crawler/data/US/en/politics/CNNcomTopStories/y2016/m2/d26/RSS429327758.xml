10 photos: God is in the pencil: The illustrated world of Beppe Giacobbe
Baggage (For Corriere della Sera, 2010) – "An image is language without lies. Every person in the world can read an image, so it's not important where you come from."

Pencil (For CNN Style, 2016) – "Across all creative disciplines, the pencil is the best tool of the mind. When I was thinking about Italian style, design, arts ... how good it all is, I thought that, in an ironic way, maybe God is in the pencil. I had decided to break the pencil before, but it was only when I saw the triangle did I think about God."

Brain (For La Lettura, 2012) – " [Artist] Paul Klee said that design has its own intelligence. You have to be receptive to understand when the drawing is telling you something. Respond as you create."

Disaster (For Corriere della Sera, 2011) – "Everything is political. I have my opinion, and I don't want to be superficial. I try to present a visual paradox, or something that can capture the reader's attention. The important thing is not to be banal."

Exploitation (For Giunti Editore, 2011) – "I have been banal many times, but I don't show those images to anyone -- they go in the bin. It's important to be critical with yourself. You might have a lot of ideas, but if they're too obvious and you are not able to understand that, it's a shame!"

Italy (For Corriere della Serra, 2013) – "In Italy, very few people know what an illustrator is, but in the USA illustrators are artists. So I don't think the distinction is important. As Milton Glaser said, 'Art is work,' so I am an artist because I work!"

Identity (For La Lettura, 2012) – "I think that young people want to have experiences. They understand that with new media, computers, it doesn't give you this. So it's important in schools -- I do this in my own classrooms -- to work in the old ways. To understand the materials. If you have this then you can transfer it to new media."

Manipulation (For Corriere della Serra, 2013) – "The computer has changed the market. Today if I had to create seven illustrations in a week, in watercolor, it would be impossible. But those traditional techniques give you something that is important in life, a process where you have to wait -- a complete contrast to today's frenetic media."

Taboo (Corriere della Serra, 2009) – "It's important to be fresh and simple, popular but not obvious. Looking at the work in Visual Dictionary, I think they chose all the times were I was both simple and rich."
