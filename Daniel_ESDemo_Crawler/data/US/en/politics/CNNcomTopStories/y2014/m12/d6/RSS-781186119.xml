(CNN) -- The Red Bull Formula One team has had its trophy cabinet cleared out by thieves in a smash-and-grab burglary Friday night.
The British-based marque has won 50 grands prix, four constructor titles and four drivers' world championships in its 10-year history.
The spoils of this success had been on display in the reception to its factory, which is based on an industrial estate in Milton Keynes, England.
"We are obviously devastated by this serious factory break-in, which saw offenders drive a vehicle through our front entrance and steal more than 60 trophies which took years and hard work to accumulate," Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement.
"The break in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time.

"Beyond the aggressive nature of this break in, we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies.
"The value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one. But their intrinsic value is low; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and, in addition to that, many of the trophies on display were replicas."
Smash and grab
Thames Valley Police are investigating the incident which took place just before 01:30 Friday.
A statement by the police, who are appealing for witnesses, detailed the robbery was carried out by around six men.
"Two cars were involved in the burglary," the statement added. "A silver 4x4 which was used to drive through the entrance and a further dark colored, black or dark blue Mercedes estate car. Both are believed to have foreign number plates."
Red Bull said it would be review access to its factory following the incident. The team has a reputation as one of the most open in the secretive world of F1.
