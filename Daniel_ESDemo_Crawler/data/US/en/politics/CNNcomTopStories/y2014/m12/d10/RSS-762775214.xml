STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Reeva Steenkamp's mother hopes the appeal will be a "good thing"
Amputee track star Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide, not murder
Prosecutors wanted Pistorius to be convicted of a more serious charge
"I don't think we should have gone this far," Pistorius' father says
Johannesburg (CNN) -- A judge in Pretoria ruled Wednesday that South African prosecutors can appeal Oscar Pistorius' conviction, but denied the state's bid to challenge his sentence.
The decision means that the decision over Pistorius' fate isn't over, with the legal battle possibly extending well into next year.
Prosecutors had said Pistorius' sentence of five years in prison for fatally shooting his girlfriend was nowhere near enough punishment.
They also want the double-amputee track star to be convicted of a more serious charge. They had originally sought conviction on a charge of murder.
Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide, or negligent killing, in the death of Reeva Steenkamp.
Oscar Pistorius reaches out to his uncle Arnold Pistorius and other family members as he is led out of court in Pretoria, South Africa, after being sentenced to five years in prison on Tuesday, October 21.

Pistorius leaves the high court in Pretoria on Monday, October 13. A judge cleared Pistorius of premeditated murder last month, but he was found guilty of culpable homicide -- the South African term for unintentionally, but unlawfully, killing a person.
