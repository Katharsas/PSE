On Tuesday night, Stephen Colbert said goodbye to the "Better Know a District" segment by returning to the first representative he interviewed back in October 2005, Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.).
Kingston — after losing the Georgia GOP Senate nomination to David Perdue — is retiring from politics, just like Colbert.
In all, Colbert interviewed 81 representatives. At that pace, he would have needed to host the Colbert Report for a few more decades to better know them all.
His summary of the segment was a brief reminder of the magic that could happen if Colbert or Jon Stewart ever were allowed to host Meet the Press" ( Stewart has actually been in the mix ). "I have fenced with Marsha Fudge," Colbert said, "I've skateboarded with Jackie Speier, I leg wrestled Jason Chaffetz, I've tossed salmon with Jim McDermott, I've drank beer with Russ Carnahan, I've shotgunned beer with Dan Maffei, I've funneled beer with Jared Polis, and I've dropped acid with Maurice Hinchey."
"You were my first congressman," Colbert told Kingston. "You know what they say about your first. It's over much quicker than you thought, and afterwards there is a lot of weeping."
This is how Kingston responded to that particular quip:
Colbert asked the representative if he had been better known by anyone else. "I have been known by others," Kingston responded.
Colbert said he had too, and also that he was supposed to tell Kingston that he had chlamydia, giving him a informational pamphlet that Kingston quickly tucked into his suit jacket -- with another priceless expression.
Kingston, an expert "Better Know a District" participant, then asked Colbert if he was the host's first and favorite person he had better known.
"Of course," Colbert said, before asking the retiring representative what his name was.
Kingston and Colbert eventually got bored of the interview, and proceeded to go make mischief.
Watch until the end to see Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) do a wheelie.
