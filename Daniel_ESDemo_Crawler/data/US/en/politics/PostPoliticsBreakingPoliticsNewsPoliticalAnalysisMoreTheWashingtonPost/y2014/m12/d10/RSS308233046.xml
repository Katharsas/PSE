You don’t often hear fans happily chanting: “We’re number 3! We’re number 3!”
But that’s what the State Department enthusiastically did in a press release when the Partnership for Public Service released its “ 2014 Best Places to Work in the Federal Government” rankings.
State noted it moved “up from 4th place overall,” and placed high in a number of categories. The department — like all federal agencies — awaited the highly regarded “Best Places” ratings with great anticipation, or perhaps fear.
But among just the 15 Cabinet agencies, State, which scored 68.2 out of 100, could have boasted “We’re number 2!” – behind the Commerce Department. And State is also second only to the Labor Department in terms of improvement over last year’s score.
1. Commerce — 68.7 (↑1.10)
