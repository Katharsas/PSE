<title>The Fix: Democrats’ Senate arm will end year $20 million in debt. That’s not why it lost.</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;News that the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee is more than $20 million in debt after getting clobbered in the midterm elections makes it natural to wonder whether the two are linked. The committee, which is responsible for getting Democrats elected to the Senate, owes $20.4 million after losing the majority in the body. (Part of the problem is that the committee also &lt;a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/dscc-debt-2014-elections-113453.html"&gt;bought a house&lt;/a&gt; this year, but that's a different story.) Is there any link between how much a committee goes into debt -- reflecting, one assumes, fundraising difficulties -- and its performance?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-senate-arm-ended-2014-20-million-in-debt-thats-not-why-they-lost/2014/12/10/bff67f87-7ac7-4863-a45b-fae6aa4518ff_story.html?wprss=rss_politics"&gt;Read full article &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636655/s/414e011a/sc/1/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612656931/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/414e011a/sc/1/rc/1/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612656931/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/414e011a/sc/1/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612656931/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/414e011a/sc/1/rc/2/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612656931/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/414e011a/sc/1/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612656931/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/414e011a/sc/1/rc/3/rc.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612656931/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/414e011a/sc/1/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612656931/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/414e011a/sc/1/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/214612656931/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/414e011a/sc/1/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/214612656931/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/414e011a/sc/1/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;</description>

News that the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee is more than $20 million in debt after getting clobbered in the midterm elections makes it natural to wonder whether the two are linked. The committee, which is responsible for getting Democrats elected to the Senate, owes $20.4 million after losing the majority in the body. (Part of the problem is that the committee also bought a house this year, but that's a different story.) Is there any link between how much a committee goes into debt -- reflecting, one assumes, fundraising difficulties -- and its performance?
Not really, no. Since 2000, the four party committees focused on Congress (the DSCC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee) have seen increasing levels of post-election debt, but it's not reflected in the Election Day results.
Part of that is because while $20.4 million sounds like a lot of money to me (and, I presume, to you), it's a relatively small percentage of the total spending by the committees over the course of the campaign. (All data here is courtesy of the exceptional Center for Responsive Politics .) The debt held by the DSCC this year is about 12 percent of what it spent over the course of the cycle -- but it can expect to fill that hole back up over the next two years. It always has.
Even outspending the opposition, though, doesn't mean you're going to win more seats. (The graph below shows spending and total post-campaign debt at the same scale, which is why the debt graph is smaller than the one above.)
But what you're probably wondering is: How often does the bigger spender (or the committee with more debt) win more seats? And the answer is: We already said it wasn't linked, why aren't you paying attention?
It's obvious why. There are trends in politics that are bigger than money can buy -- the Republican waves in 2010 and 2014; the Democratic sweep in 2006. In times like those, the opposing parties are likely to do poorly no matter how much they spend. As we have seen.
