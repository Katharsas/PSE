 The Senior Executives Association’s  Professional Development League and the Volcker Alliance are forming a group of current and former senior government leaders to advise policy makers and to serve as a resource for researchers examining ways to improve the federal government. 
The group is called the Distinguished Executives Alumni Network , DEAN’s List for short. Its members will be past winners of the Presidential Distinguished Rank Award, the highest honor given to federal senior-level managers.
“For far too long, the government has failed to take advantage of the invaluable resource these awardees represent,” said SEA President Carol Bonosaro. “With the support of The Volcker Alliance, we are able to develop the means to change that.”
Volcker Alliance President Shelley Metzenbaum said the DEAN’s List “promises to be a great resource…by engaging the top one percent of the most highly regarded senior executives and senior professionals in the federal government and allowing elected officials, appointees, other government leaders, and researchers to access their invaluable expertise.”
The Volcker Alliance is chaired by Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve System. It was formed last year, says its Web site , to promote “effective execution of public policies and to rebuild public trust in government.”
