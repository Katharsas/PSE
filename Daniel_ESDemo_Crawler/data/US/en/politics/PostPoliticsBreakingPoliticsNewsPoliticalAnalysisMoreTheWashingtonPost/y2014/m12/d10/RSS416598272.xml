Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), the outgoing chairman of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, once described himself as the " bane of John Boehner's existence ."
He could just as easily been talking about Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the committee with whom Issa fought epically during his four years with the gavel. Their feud featured dueling leaks , Issa accusing Cummings of colluding with the IRS , and Cummings accusing Issa of  "scuttling"  the chance to have former IRS official Lois Lerner testify before Congress.
All of it came to an end at Tuesday's Jonathan Gruber hearing , with some bromantic moments that almost made us forget all their fights. Looking back on their relationship, Issa told The Washington Examiner  that Cummings tried to make good on his promise to stop him at every step. But there was some progress:
Examiner: You’ve certainly had some public squabbles with Ranking Member Cummings. How would you describe your working relationship with him overall these past four years, as well as the other Democrats on the panel?
Issa: It was actually quite good. We passed whistleblower reform on a bipartisan basis, federal IT reform is sitting in the Senate and hopefully will soon be law, the DATA [Digital Accountability and Transparency] act — all of these were passed broadly bipartisan. [But] we couldn’t pass legislation on a bipartisan basis for things like [issues regarding] federal employees of the Postal Service. The Democrats are stridently trying to hold onto jobs that cause the post office to lose billions of dollars every year, because they’re union jobs that pay union dues.
Some of that good feeling was present at Issa's last hearing, with both saying they learned from each other and that they made each other better. Better at what is anybody's guess:
Issa notably said that he "would do things differently with what I now know."
Perhaps he is talking about that time he shut down a hearing about the IRS, cut off mics, and said, "we're adjourned, close it down," as Cummings was trying to ask a question.
Leave it to Congress to have two people constantly at odds with each other to, when all is said and done, pretend like they are best of friends.
