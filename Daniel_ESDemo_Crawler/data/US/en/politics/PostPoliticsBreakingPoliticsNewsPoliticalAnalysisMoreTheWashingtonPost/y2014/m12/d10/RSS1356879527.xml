In the past week, Ready for Warren, the designated organization for those ready for President (and current Massachusetts Sen.) Elizabeth Warren, is showing signs of readiness. They are  ready to gather signatures.  They are ready to hire former Obama campaign workers. They are ready to make the hashtag #ReadyforWarren a thing. Other organizations, like MoveOn.org, have also signaled their readiness.
However, they do not appear ready to acknowledge that they are not the first people in political history to be ready for Warren.  Americans in 1920, after all, thought they were ready for Warren ... G. Harding.

Now  he is remembered  as one of the worst presidents in history. Think about that.
However, Elizabeth Warren's supporters might still be in the clear. It seems that Harding's supporters were mostly limited to boats, which may explain his lack of lasting support (along with the Teapot Dome Scandal , perhaps).

It might also be unwise to trust anyone who says they are ready for Hillary. There is a not-so-negligible chance that they might be talking about someone else.

Anyway, it's worth putting out there.
