Congress is willing to pay for increased embassy security, but not for glitzy new aesthetics.
Tucked inside the $1.01 trillion spending bill that Congress released late Tuesday is a provision that once again bars the federal government from spending a dime on a new fancy U.S. Embassy in London.
American diplomats posted in London are expected to move into a more modern and upscale space in 2017 that is reportedly going to cost around $1 billion. The issue of whether the new embassy needs to be so costly came up during a congressional hearing in July about embassy security, and some lawmakers questioned whether the State Department was prioritizing “pretty buildings” over security.
Even so, Congress’ move won’t derail the already-underway project. Funds were also blocked in last year’s omnibus spending measure.
At that time, U.S. Ambassador Matthew Barzun quickly responded to news reports about the funding ban.
“The new building project is being funded entirely by the proceeds of the sale of other U.S. Government properties in London, not through appropriated funds. This has always been the plan. The proposed Omnibus Spending Bill does not provide any new, additional, restrictions to that plan,” he wrote in the embassy’s “Special Relationship Magazine.”
Embassy security overall is a big winner in the spending bill. According to colleague Ed O’Keefe’s breakdown of key components of the massive bill, there is “$5.4 billion for security at U.S. embassies worldwide, $46 million more than Obama requested.”
Of course it’s not like the new embassy isn’t going to have security enhancements. A Washington Post article in 2010 announcing the winning architect to design the new building described it this way:
A semicircular pond will function as a protective moat along the Thames side, while a spiraling landscape to the south sets the building away from potential car or truck bombs. A complex envelope of blast-resistant glass and a polymer skin (known as ETFE) will provide both security and energy efficiency while shading the building on its sun-exposed sides.
