<title>Clarence Thomas: The Supreme Court’s most happy fella</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;There was a different Clarence Thomas onstage at &lt;a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.fed-soc.org/"&gt;the Federalist Society&lt;/a&gt;’s annual gala Thursday night. In the words of the playwright, he was the Supreme Court’s most happy fella.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In front of an adoring crowd of 1,300 conservatives and being gently interviewed by Judge Diane S. Sykes of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in Chicago, Thomas was full of “love”: for his colleagues, for his law clerks, for his wife, for his life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clarence-thomas-the-supreme-courts-most-happy-fella/2013/11/15/7e28d82a-4dec-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html?wprss=rss_politics"&gt;Read full article &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636655/s/33b94727/sc/8/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;div class='mf-viral'&gt;&lt;table border='0'&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign='middle'&gt;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Fclarence-thomas-the-supreme-courts-most-happy-fella%2F2013%2F11%2F15%2F7e28d82a-4dec-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_politics&amp;t=Clarence+Thomas%3A+The+Supreme+Court%E2%80%99s+most+happy+fella" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Fclarence-thomas-the-supreme-courts-most-happy-fella%2F2013%2F11%2F15%2F7e28d82a-4dec-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_politics&amp;t=Clarence+Thomas%3A+The+Supreme+Court%E2%80%99s+most+happy+fella" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Fclarence-thomas-the-supreme-courts-most-happy-fella%2F2013%2F11%2F15%2F7e28d82a-4dec-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_politics&amp;t=Clarence+Thomas%3A+The+Supreme+Court%E2%80%99s+most+happy+fella" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Fclarence-thomas-the-supreme-courts-most-happy-fella%2F2013%2F11%2F15%2F7e28d82a-4dec-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_politics&amp;t=Clarence+Thomas%3A+The+Supreme+Court%E2%80%99s+most+happy+fella" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Fclarence-thomas-the-supreme-courts-most-happy-fella%2F2013%2F11%2F15%2F7e28d82a-4dec-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_politics&amp;t=Clarence+Thomas%3A+The+Supreme+Court%E2%80%99s+most+happy+fella" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264122122/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/33b94727/sc/8/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264122122/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/33b94727/sc/8/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264122122/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/33b94727/sc/8/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264122122/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/33b94727/sc/8/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264122122/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/33b94727/sc/8/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264122122/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/33b94727/sc/8/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264122122/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/33b94727/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264122122/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/33b94727/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/180264122122/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/33b94727/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;</description>

<ExtractedText>Cruz: Despite shutdown, Defund Obamacare ‘absolutely’ worth it
Aaron Blake
Cruz made made the comment while being interviewed by Fox News’s Chris Wallace at the Aspen Ideas Forum at The Newseum in Washington.

There were even kind words for Yale Law School , from which Thomas was once so estranged that he adorned the frame of his diploma with a cheap cigar price tag and stowed it in his basement.
“I never thought that I would treasure doing my job, and I’ve reached that point,” Thomas, 65, said. “Even the most boring cases to others are fascinating to me.”
He said: “I’ve gotten to this point where it’s like the priesthood,” for which he once trained. “This is what I’m called to do.”
Quite a contrast from the moment more than 22 years ago when his wife, Virginia, delivered the news that the bitter battle over his nomination had concluded with the Senate voting narrowly to confirm him.
“Whoop-de-damn-do,” was the reaction he recounted in his memoir, “ My Grandfather’s Son .” The book is both a testimonial to his hardworking grandfather and a bitter, score-settling takedown of his enemies.
Thomas remains the court’s most complicated and controversial member. To the part of the public that pays attention to the court, he is perhaps best known for not asking questions at oral arguments. For the few who make it to the court to witness the justices at work, he is always silent, usually rocking far back in his leather chair, eyes skyward.
Outside the court, Thomas has often complained about the burdens of his lifetime appointment. At an event in 2009 for high school students, the justice recalled looking longingly from his chamber windows at the seemingly carefree passing pedestrians.
“I tend to be morose sometimes,” he said, describing his job as an “endeavor” that sometimes could be called “an ordeal.”
But his colleagues and friends talk of a different person — one with a booming laugh and welcoming word for everyone who works at the marble palace, from the chief justice to the janitor.
It was that Thomas literally on display on the giant video screens in the vast ballroom of the Omni Shoreham, a grinning man in a vested tuxedo, his now-receding hair a startling white.
He laughed about his past as a campus radical at Holy Cross College (“But I was never a dopehead,” he said), his support of the Black Panthers, his appeal to God to cure his hatred and his unlikely path to the court, which he said began with a decision in 1979 to pack his belongings in a U-Haul and move to Washington.
“And fortuitously, again, good people looking out for me, Senator [John] Danforth, offered me a job. And so I came here, and I was only going to stay a couple of years and go back to Savannah, and one thing led to another, and I ended up on the court,” he said.
As the crowd’s laughter died down, Thomas added: ‘No, it was like totally ‘Forrest Gump.’ ”
