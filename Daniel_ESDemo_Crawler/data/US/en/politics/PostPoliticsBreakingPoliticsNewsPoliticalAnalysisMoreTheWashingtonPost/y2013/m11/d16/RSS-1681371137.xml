<ExtractedText>Suburban Detroit man charged with killing woman who may have needed help after crash
MICHIGAN
Man charged in death
of stranger in need
A suburban Detroit homeowner was charged Friday with second-degree murder in the death of a 19-year-old woman who was shot in the face while on his front porch two weeks ago.
Theodore P. Wafer, 54, of Dearborn Heights also faces a manslaughter charge in the death of Renisha McBride, who was killed early on Nov. 2, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said.
Police say that McBride, a former high school cheerleader, was shot a couple hours after being involved in a nearby car accident. Family members say she likely approached Wafer’s home for help.
The shooting has drawn attention from civil rights groups, who called for a thorough investigation and believe that race was a factor in the shooting. McBride was black; Wafer is white, prosecutors say.

Sick boy transformed into a superhero
Dressed in a black Batman costume, his fists clenched as he took on foe after foe across San Francisco, a 5-year-old boy who has battled leukemia for years fulfilled his wish Friday to be his favorite superhero.
In the process, Miles Scott became a darling of social media and attracted thousands of fans across the country, including at the White House.
Batkid was called into service by San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr to help fight crime. He rescued a woman from cable car tracks in Nob Hill and captured the Riddler in the act of robbing a downtown bank.
Miles even rescued the San Francisco Giants’ mascot — Lou Seal — who had been kidnapped by the Penguin.
Miles, who is in remission, was able to fulfill his wish through the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the city.
Batkid had a police escort worthy of a dignitary, as he sped across the city in a black Lamborghini with a Batman decal while motorcycle officers rode alongside him and blocked traffic. The White House sent out a tweet encouraging Batkid to “Go get ’em!”

Rewards for tips
in Benghazi attack
The State Department said Friday that since January, it has been quietly offering rewards of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of any person involved in last year’s attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya.
The announcement ends weeks of silence by the Obama administration about whether it was using all available means to catch the culprits in the Benghazi attack.
In a letter sent to lawmakers Friday, the department said the rewards were not publicized on its “Rewards for Justice” Web site, as is normally done, because of security issues concerning the investigation into the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the mission, which killed. U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.
A State Department official familiar with the letter sent to Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) by Julia Frifield, assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs, said the rewards have been in place since Jan. 7, while Hillary Rodham Clinton was still secretary of state.

Immigration exception for close relatives of service members: The Obama administration will allow close relatives of U.S. service members living in the country illegally to stay, according to a policy directive issued Friday. The  memorandum gives immigration officials the power to “parole in place” immigrant spouses, children and parents of current U.S. service members, reservists and veterans. The change means that those immigrants can apply to legally live in the United States.

Hacker sentenced to 10 years: A Chicago computer hacker tied to the group Anonymous was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for cyberattacks on various government agencies and businesses, including a global intelligence company. Jeremy Hammond, 28, was handed the maximum term for the December 2011 hacking of Strategic Forecasting, an attack his attorneys contend was driven by concern about the role of private firms in gathering intelligence domestically and abroad.
