David Vitter’s political quest to embarrass Congress on health care
J. Scott Applewhite/AP - Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) walks to the Senate at the Capitol in Washington on  Nov. 12.
By David A. Fahrenthold , E-mail the writer
This week, once again, Sen. David Vitter did not get his way.
On Wednesday, in a speech on a near-empty Senate floor, Vitter (R-La.) returned to a lonely quest that has obsessed him since September. He is unhappy — very unhappy — with the health insurance plans available to Congress’s staff.

The law has more headaches than just HealthCare.gov. "In Play" asks some of The Washington Post's top political reporters to explain.

The problem, Vitter says, is that those plans are too good.
Under the president’s health-care law, Congress and much of its staff are supposed to lose their old health plans and instead buy coverage on the “exchanges” set up for individual Americans. But Vitter says that they are slated to get improper help, including money from the federal government, and that special loopholes allow some to keep their old coverage.
Vitter wants that to stop.
And so he has embarked on an improbable mission: to persuade other legislators to take valued benefits away from the very staffers who write their speeches, guide their votes, answer their mail and remind them of the birthdays of spouses and the names of Rotary Club presidents back home.
This plan has not been working.
On Wednesday, it did not work again.
“I object,” said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) , thereby shooting down Vitter’s latest effort — to require members to disclose whether staffers are being shielded from the health-care law — by adding an amendment to an unrelated bill that would increase oversight of compounding pharmacies. Vitter had held up the popular bill’s passage in hopes of getting a vote.
“That’s unfortunate,” Vitter said.
Vitter — a conservative in his second Senate term — has introduced at least three bills and an amendment on this topic. Since September, he has given at least 12 speeches about it on the Senate floor.
For Vitter, this is a chance to embarrass the rest of Washington, and especially Democrats, in the eyes of conservatives around the country. His central argument is that within Congress’s benefits, there are provisions so gob-smacking that — if somebody just explained it to the American public — they would see it as proof of Washington’s outrageous arrogance.
Congress “wants to impose these new rules on the rest of America; it doesn’t want to live by them itself,” Vitter said in a Senate floor speech last month. “It is sort of like when a person walks into a restaurant and hears that the chef never, ever eats at that restaurant, never, ever has a meal out of that kitchen. It makes a person wonder.”
There are problems here. One is a problem inside the Capitol. So far, legislators have not been willing to alienate the staffers they see every day in order to please conservative voters that they don’t.
The other problem hampers Vitter’s case outside the Capitol. That problem is that the health insurance provisions he’s basing his argument on are not easy to explain.
Start here: In President Obama’s health-care law , there is a provision saying that members of Congress and staffers in the legislators’ “official offices” must obtain coverage on the new exchanges. That starts Jan. 1. That’s a change from the situation now, in which legislators and staffers can choose among plans provided by the federal government, which are also offered to a wide range of other federal employees.
