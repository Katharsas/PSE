<ExtractedText>FIFA upholds bans for the two former senior officials
Bans reduced from eight years to six, citing the men's contribution to world football
Decision comes two days before new FIFA president due to be elected
(CNN)
FIFA has denied appeals from its former president Sepp Blatter and his one-time heir apparent, former UEFA president Michel Platini, to strike down their bans from "all football-related activities."
The two men had been banned for eight years each following the FIFA Ethics Committee's findings that Platini had received a two-million Swiss franc ($2.02 million) "advisory payment" from Blatter.
The Committee found that they had broken FIFA Code of Ethics relating to conflicts of interest, breach of loyalty and gifts. The pair were cleared of bribery and corruption allegations.

Just ahead of its presidential vote Friday, the appeal committee did reduce both men's bans from eight to six years, citing their service to football as justification for the reduction.

A statement posted on the global governing body's website stated that "some strong mitigating factors for Mr .Platini and Mr. Blatter were not taken into account when establishing the sanction."
It suggested that the "activities and the services they had rendered to FIFA, UEFA and football in general over the years should deserve appropriate recognition as a mitigating factor."
The two former officials are also obliged to pay fines, with Platini owing FIFA 80,000 Swiss francs ($80,873) and Blatter 50,000 Swiss francs($50,541).
Platini, the former Juventus and French national team legend, said that the decision not to repeal the ban was ""insulting... shameful and a denial of rights."
He said he would appeal through the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
Blatter, who in October 2015 was forced to step down after 17 years in charge of football's governing body, said in a statement that he was "deeply disappointed" with the verdict, which means he will be unable to preside over Friday's election for his permanent successor at an Extraordinary Congress.
