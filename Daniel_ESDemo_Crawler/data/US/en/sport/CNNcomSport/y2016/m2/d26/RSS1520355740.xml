Shaun White targets 2018 Winter Games
Sight of Dad in tears at Turin Olympics in 2006 is defining image of career
Lessons learned from Sochi 4th place are 'humbling'
(CNN)
He flies and spins high above the halfpipe, pulling tricks such as the Double McTwist 1260, but for snowboarder Shaun White the defining memory of his career is still the sight of his dad crying.
Once dubbed the "Flying Tomato" because of his flowing red hair, White won Olympic gold medals for his aerial antics in Turin and Vancouver.
Despite becoming an icon of his sport, White failed to add to his haul in Sochi, but the pain of defeat is spurring him on for redemption in South Korea in 2018.
Nothing, though, will surpass winning that first gold in front of his family in Italy in 2006.
"It's the obvious one that stands out the most -- the very first one, nothing really compares to that," the 29-year-old American recently told CNN.
White's family were all in tears when he won gold in Turin - including his dad.

"I remember getting to the bottom of the halfpipe and I'd just won the Olympics. You see your family, everyone is crying and you can handle that -- your mum, brother, sister. Everyone is so overwhelmed with joy.
"But when your dad is crying? There's something about the dad tears that really get you. He's the tough figure in your life and he's just bawling and it cuts to the core of you."
