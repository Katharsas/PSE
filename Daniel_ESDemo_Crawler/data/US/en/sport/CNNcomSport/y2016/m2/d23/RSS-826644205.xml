Patricia Garcia, Spain – "Any half line-break, she's awesome at covering and getting straight on the ball," said Scarratt says of the Spanish playmaker. "As an opponent, it's very frustrating when you think you've done something good and then she's got the ball and turned it over."

Marjorie Mayans, France – "She's a really tough cookie," Scarratt says of the 25-year-old, who played at the 15-a-side World Cup in 2014. "She carries the ball really well, does the stuff that not everyone likes to do in sevens because it's a bit too gritty."

Jillion Potter , United States – The 29-year-old U.S. captain has overcome cancer and major surgery during a successful sevens career. "Jillion has an unreal story, having come back from what she's been through," Scarratt says. "To have her back on the field means an awful lot to everyone."
