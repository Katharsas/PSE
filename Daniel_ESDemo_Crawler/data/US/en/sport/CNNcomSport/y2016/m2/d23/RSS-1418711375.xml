<ExtractedText>Nick Kyrgios wins maiden ATP title
Beats Marin Cilic in Marseille final
Rafael Nadal loses Rio semifinal
Fine comeback by Juan Martin del Potro
(CNN)
Maybe this is the year that Nick Kyrgios lets his obvious tennis talent do the talking.
The 20-year-old Australian gave the first indication he is heading for a major breakthrough by claiming the Marseille title, beating former U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic 6-2 7-6 in the final Sunday.

It completed a stunning week for Kyrgios at the hard court tournament in southern France, having beaten two players in the world top 10 and a grand slam champion to lift the trophy.
10th-ranked Frenchman Richard Gasquet and world number eight Tomas Berdych fell victim to the big-serving young gun before he saw off fourth seed Cilic with another impressive display.

His straight sets victory over Berdych was revenge for a third round defeat in his home grand slam in Australia last month, while he had lost his previous encounter with Cilic in 2013.
Two breaks of service in the first set saw Kyrgios make early inroads in the final. The second set was closer with no breaks of service, but Kyrgios closed out the tiebreaker 7-3 with his 17th ace to complete his triumph.
Krygios at full stretch during his straights sets win over Cilic to claim his first ATP title.
It was only his second tournament of the year after having to pull out of Rotterdam with injury and taking the title was a surprise.
"But I didn't really expect to win this title this week after having a couple of weeks off. But from the first round I started playing really well and just gained confidence as I kept winning matches," Kyrgios told the official ATP Tour website.
World number 41 Kyrgios first burst to prominence at Wimbledon in 2014 when he stunned Rafael Nadal on his way to the quarterfinals, leaving many to believe he would soon be challenging for grand slam titles.
Controversial incidents
But his career has stalled with only a quarterfinal appearance at the Australian Open in 2013 in the majors, while courting controversy in several incidents.

Nick Kyrgios landed in hot water -- again -- after sledging Stan Wawrinka during their tennis match at the Rogers Cup in Montreal. He was later fined by the ATP, which then added a suspended punishment.
