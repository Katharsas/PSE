<ExtractedText>Can you see Cuba Gooding Jr. playing O.J. Simpson?
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
December 10, 2014 -- Updated 1259 GMT (2059 HKT)
Cuba Gooding Jr. will play O.J. Simpson in Ryan Murphy's new FX miniseries.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The actor has been cast in "American Crime Story"
The miniseries comes from "American Horror Story" creator Ryan Murphy
Sarah Paulson is set to play Marcia Clarke
(CNN) -- Playing a football player won Cuba Gooding Jr. an Oscar. Could playing another -- one who was the focus of "the trial of the century" -- win him further accolades?
The actor has been cast as O.J. Simpson in the new FX anthology miniseries "American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson," the network announced. Gooding won the Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role in 1996 for his performance as wide receiver Rod Tidwell in the film "Jerry Maguire."
The new miniseries will focus on the famous trial and according to a statement is "told from the perspective of the lawyers that explores the chaotic behind-the-scenes dealings and maneuvering on both sides of the court, and how a combination of prosecution confidence, defense wiliness, and the LAPD's history with the city's African-American community gave a jury what it needed: reasonable doubt."
The miniseries was developed by Ryan Murphy, who created the very successful "American Horror Story" anthology franchise for FX. Murphy didn't have to look far for his Marcia Clarke; the prosecuting attorney will be played by Sarah Paulson, who has appeared in all four seasons of "American Horror Story."
Each season of "American Crime Story" will delve into a different true crime story that made headlines and captivated the public. The first season is based on the book "The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson" by CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.
Production is scheduled to begin early next year in Los Angeles.
