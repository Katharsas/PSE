<ExtractedText>Aziz Ansari's imagination takes flight as he creates #GhostPlane
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
December 8, 2014 -- Updated 1312 GMT (2112 HKT)
Comedian and actor Aziz Ansari may have hit movie gold during a boring flight.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Comedian and actor Aziz Ansari got bored on a flight Sunday
He started tweeting ideas for a film about a haunted plane
Unfortunately, the tale ended on a cliffhanger
(CNN) -- Well, that's one way to crowdsource.
"Parks and Recreation" star Aziz Ansari tweeted Sunday that he was bored on a flight, and what followed had all of the makings of a Hollywood movie.
The comic questioned why there has never been a film about a haunted plane: "Wouldn't that be dope?" He then started tweeting ideas and a script for a project he dubbed "Ghost Plane."
Quicker than you could say "I'll make you a star," #GhostPlane took off.
Bored on my flight and just wondering - why has there never been a movie about a haunted airplane? Wouldn't that be dope?

"Dude. For real. Is any studios into GHOST PLANE? I can make it cheap. It's all one location. Just the plane," Ansari tweeted.

The idea goes like this, according to Ansari's tweets: "Open on Indian guy RAJ (Aziz Ansari) saying bye to his parents. He gets on the plane. But this plane is actually a GHOST PLANE. #GhostPlane."

"Raj uses the plane washroom pre-takeoff. He sees a face in the mirror. 'This might be a ghost' he thinks.... #GhostPlane," the actor added.

Don't even worry about casting. There's a role for Jennifer Lawrence as "Flight attendant Anne" and fellow Academy Award winner Tom Hanks as "The Captain." But our favorite character might be embodied in this tweet: "A mysterious man in a hoodie: 'If you want to stop the dolls. You need my help.' He lifts the hood: ITS LIAM NEESON AS HIMSELF! #GhostPlane."

Because of course it's Liam freaking Neeson.
Fans were really into it. On person tweeted, "Now I can't sleep because @azizansari is telling the most magnificent story #GhostPlane" while another said, "A studio needs to pick up @azizansari's #GhostPlane IMMEDIATELY. If not we'll just make a kickstarter. It'll be cheap."

We will have to wait to see how it all pans out.
Ansari said, "Sorry everyone. #GhostPlane is on pause. I just got home and have to be up early to shoot Parks. I'll try to finish this sometime."
