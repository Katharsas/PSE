<ExtractedText>John Oliver leaving 'The Daily Show' for new HBO series
By Hillary Busis, EW
November 14, 2013 -- Updated 2217 GMT (0617 HKT)
John Oliver says he is very excited about his upcoming HBO series.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Oliver has been a correspondent on "The Daily Show" since 2006
His new HBO comedy series is slated for 2014
This summer he filled in for "Daily Show" host Jon Stewart
( EW.com ) -- The bad news: Emmy-award winning comedian John Oliver is leaving "The Daily Show," where he's been serving as a correspondent since 2006.
The good news: He'll be moving to HBO for a brand-new topical comedy series, slated to launch in 2014. The show will air weekly on Sunday nights.
Oliver caught the cable giant's eye this summer, when he spent two months filling in for "Daily Show" host Jon Stewart. "We weren't otherwise searching for another weekly talk show, but when we saw John Oliver handling host duties on The Daily Show, we knew that his singular perspective and distinct voice belonged on HBO," said HBO Programming president Michael Lombardo said in a statement. "We are extremely excited that John has agreed to make HBO his home."
"I'm incredibly excited to be joining HBO, especially as I presume this means I get free HBO now," Oliver added. "I want to thank Comedy Central, and everyone at The Daily Show for the best seven and a half years of my life. But most of all, I'd like to thank Jon Stewart. He taught me everything I know. In fact, if I fail in the future, it's entirely his fault."
