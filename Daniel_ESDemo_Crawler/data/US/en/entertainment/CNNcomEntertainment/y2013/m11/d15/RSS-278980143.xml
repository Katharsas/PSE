<ExtractedText>Jennifer Lawrence was Josh Hutcherson's first
By Breeanna Hare, CNN
November 15, 2013 -- Updated 2115 GMT (0515 HKT)
While most actresses are careful to give the press only the most pristine soundbites, Jennifer Lawrence is known for doing the exact opposite. Even better, it's worked in her favor: The 23-year-old is adored for her off-the-cuff wisecracks and random outbursts, all of which make her seem so normal. Here are some of our favorite JLaw quotes.
On meeting John Stamos at a party: "I turned into a perverted guy, I was following him into rooms and staring at his a**. ... I just started really freaking out, and he asked me if I was on mushrooms, and I was like, 'No, I am dead sober. This is just me.' " -- To Conan O'Brien in 2013
On being so popular: "My main worry is that people will start hating what I hate about myself. I worry that everybody will think I am really annoying and just want me to shut up. Which would make so much sense because I annoy myself. ... I guess I want people to know that if they are annoyed with me, I get it, it's totally cool. Please forgive me." -- November 2013
On her social life: "I don't like going out that much. I'm kind of an old lady. After it's 11, I'm like 'Don't these kids ever get tired?' When I'm out, I think about my couch." -- Marie Claire South Africa, January 2013
On friendship: "Girls that don't have girl friends worry me, because girls don't like bitches. Whenever I hear girls who say, 'Girls just don't like me,' I'm like, 'Well, girls don't like bitches, so ...' " -- The Telegraph March 2012
On how to prepare for the Oscars: "I did a shot before." -- February 2013
On staying humble: "Not to sound rude, but (acting) is stupid. Everybody's like, 'How can you remain with a level head?' And I'm like, 'Why would I ever get cocky? I'm not saving anybody's life. There are doctors who save lives and firemen who run into burning buildings. I'm making movies. It's stupid.'" -- Vanity Fair, January 2013
On her acting style: "No, I'm not method at all. As soon as they call 'cut,' I'm thinking about food and moving on." -- November 2012
On pressure to be thin: "If anybody even tries to whisper the word 'diet,' I'm like, 'You can go f*** yourself.' " -- October 2013
On her quotable honesty: "I'm so aware of all the B.S. that surrounds Hollywood, and how everyone gets on this high horse and thinks that they're curing cancer and it makes me so uncomfortable every time I see it. So I go in the exact opposite direction and end up saying something like 'I'm pregnant!' when I'm in two franchises." -- January 2013
Her first sentence to Woody Harrelson: " 'Hi, Woody, I'm J -- is that a sex swing?' " -- April 2012
On what she'd do with more free time: "I would spend more time on the couch, less time showering. If I don't have anything to do all day, I might not put my pants on." -- March 2012
Her advice to young girls struggling with body image: "Screw those people (who judge others based on appearance). If you don't look like an airbrushed model ...you have to look past it. You look how you look. What are you going to do, be hungry every single day to make other people happy? That's just dumb." -- November 2013
HIDE CAPTION
Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson co-star in "The Hunger Games" franchise
Hutcherson says Lawrence was his first 'real big kiss' in a film
He says Lawrence was pretty abrasive
She agrees that it was 'very slobbery'
(CNN) -- When it comes to on-screen chemistry, "Hunger Games" co-stars Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are naturals.
"We're great together," Lawrence, 23, told CNN in a recent interview. "We can really kiss."
Jennifer Lawrence cried at Whole Foods
To be sure, the two have had plenty of practice. As "Hunger Games" characters Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, Lawrence and Hutcherson are asked to do some lip-locking on camera in both 2012's "The Hunger Games" and its November 22 follow-up, "Catching Fire."
Peeta dishes on kissing Katniss
If you're not familiar with the book trilogy from Suzanne Collins that the movies are based on, know that part of the central plot revolves around Katniss and Peeta's relationship -- it's mostly a survival strategy as the two impoverished District 12 citizens are sent to fight to the death in the sadistic Hunger Games, but there's also an undercurrent of something more. There's the additional complication of Katniss' relationship with childhood friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), who's a likely lover as well.
So as Katniss, Lawrence isn't wanting for love scenes. Yet in her typical casual manner, the Oscar-winning actress can shrug it off.
"You just kiss," she said to CNN, admitting, "I've had a couple bad ones."
Hutcherson, though, isn't disappointing, although the 21-year-old actor isn't quite as experienced as his counterpart.
"I haven't had any bad ones," Hutcherson said, telling Lawrence, "You're my first real big kiss in a movie."
"Really?" Lawrence responded. "Oh my God, was I gentle?"
To be frank, "no," Hutcherson replied. "It was a little abrasive, if I'm being honest. A little shocking."
"It was very slobbery," Lawrence agreed.
That sort of honest, spontaneous exchange is what makes the duo, but especially Lawrence, so in demand. Just three years ago, Lawrence was best known for an indie film called "Winter's Bone," which earned the actress her first Oscar nomination. But then came an onslaught of films that permanently changed the tide, as Lawrence starred in one high-profile project after another: 2011's "The Beaver" and "X-Men: First Class," "The Hunger Games," and 2012's acclaimed "Silver Linings Playbook," which earned the young star an Oscar.
Born in Kentucky with two older brothers, Lawrence presents herself with an unguarded irreverence that both Hollywood and the public eat up with spoons. Even as she transformed into one of the biggest stars in the industry, Lawrence remains grounded and outspoken in her interviews, seemingly unaware of her celebrity status.
When she won the best actress Oscar for "Silver Linings Playbook," nothing changed on set, Hutcherson told CNN.
"I don't even think we had a conversation about it," Lawrence said. "You guys were like, 'Congratulations, that's great.' And then it was like, 'Cool.' Then we started talking about farts."
And yet, as the public face of a franchise that has thus far made $691 million worldwide, Lawrence isn't completely oblivious to her new place in the world.
When the first "Hunger Games" movie came out, the actress tried to stop by Whole Foods, and was quickly reminded of just how famous she's become.
"Literally the day the movie was released, I had no idea I was famous yet or that anybody had seen the movie," she said. "I don't think actually I knew the movie came out that day."
Whole Foods "had to call the police and I had to go down the cargo elevator and I was crying. And I saw my ex-boyfriend there and he's like, 'How's your life?' And I was like, 'Really bad.' It was the worst."
Her popularity began to make her nervous about appearing in public, and she would skirt dinner plans to avoid the inevitable requests for a photograph. But she's learned that one has to face fame the way you would face anything else.
"Sometimes I'm nice, sometimes I'm in a bad mood," Lawrence said. "Like if I'm at dinner and I'm eating and somebody wants me to stand up and take a picture -- that's actually helped with my anxiety, knowing that I don't have to say yes and I can say no. ... It is hard because you don't want to feel rude, but at the same time, I have to defend my life and my mental wellness."
