Best picture: For much of awards season, "Spotlight" was leading the best picture race. The film, about a group of investigative reporters looking into sexual abuse by Catholic priests, won best film honors from the broadcast film critics, the American Film Institute and the SAG Awards, among others.
But in recent weeks, "The Revenant," starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a vengeful trapper left for dead in the 1820s frontier, has come on strong. It won the Golden Globe for best drama, the BAFTA for best film and the Directors Guild honor. "The Revenant" was also nominated for pack-leading 12 Oscars, often a good indicator of best picture strength.
Still, don't count out such nominees as "The Big Short," about financial wizards who take advantage of the 2008 market meltdown, or "Room," which may be helped by a best picture voting system that gives everyone's second choice an edge. Assuming "Room" is everyone's second choice.
Best director: Usually, picture and director are in lockstep, so "Revenant's" win at the DGA helps its director, Alejandro González Iñárritu. If Iñárritu, who won for "Birdman" last year, wins again, he'll be the just the third director to win consecutive best director trophies -- and the first in 65 years, since Joseph L. Mankiewicz did it for 1949's "A Letter to Three Wives" and 1950's "All About Eve."
However, "Mad Max: Fury Road's" George Miller has earned strong support from critics' organizations, and if enough Oscar voters have been impressed by his handling of the film's wild bikers and gleeful action sequences, he could sneak in.
Best actor: There's really no question here: If the winner isn't Leonardo DiCaprio, it will be the biggest shocker since Roberto Benigni won for "Life Is Beautiful" in 1999. Not only has DiCaprio never won -- despite his performances in such films as "The Aviator" and "The Wolf of Wall Street" -- he ate a bison liver for his role. The academy loves that kind of commitment.
