Oscars 2016: All eyes on Chris Rock
Updated 1535 GMT (2335 HKT) February 26, 2016
JUST WATCHED
#OscarsSoWhite not just black and white 01:40
Story highlights
Since the nominations, the discussion has been dominated by #OscarsSoWhite
Host Chris Rock may have something to say about the controversy
"Revenant," "Spotlight" are among the leading nominees
(CNN)
The big question for the 88th Academy Awards can be reduced to five letters: WWCRD?
What Will Chris Rock Do?
The Oscars may be about pageantry, tedium and -- oh, yeah -- honoring the best cinematic efforts of the year, but this season, there's been an addition to the usual niceties: #OscarsSoWhite.
You may remember it from last year.
This sequel was probably about as welcome as "Jack and Jill 2." #OscarsSoWhite became a trending topic last year thanks to the lack of people of color among acting nominees. Two years in a row? The movie capital and its institutions probably hoped the issue would have gone away.

Enter Rock, who's hosting the show. He wasted no time in cracking a joke about the controversy on Twitter : "The #Oscars. The White BET Awards," he wrote the day after nominations were announced.

— Chris Rock (@chrisrock) January 15, 2016
Academy Awards show producer Reginald Hudlin said in January that Rock was rewriting his monologue, though a rep for Rock quickly said that the comedian had made "no decisions about the content of the show."
"All will be revealed on February 28th. We will not comment further on this," Rock's publicist, Leslie Sloane, told The Hollywood Reporter .
Rock's comedy is known for tackling societal issues head-on -- and poking fun at sacred cows. Indeed, during his 2005 Oscar hosting gig, he showed how Hollywood was "out of touch" with a bit in which he interviewed African-American moviegoers, none of whom had seen the best picture nominees.
Motion Picture Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs said she expected nothing less from him this year.
"We want him to (go there), obviously, because way before this, our selection of Chris was to bring some edge and some fun and some funny -- intelligent funny -- to the telecast," she told The Hollywood Reporter . "So we know he's going to do that."
Other celebrities, including Jada Pinkett Smith and Spike Lee, chose a different tack. They're not going to the ceremony. ( Lee was careful to note he didn't use the word "boycott.") Lee's snub is particularly pointed, as he received an honorary Oscar in November.
Still, Lee said Rock can do what he likes.
"Chris Rock is a grown-a** man," Lee told "Good Morning America." "He's just going to do what he wants to do, and I support either way."
Who's going to win?
Rock's hosting may be the only surprise of what's become a ceremony with few wild cards.
Oscar handicappers have kept a close eye on the nominees, and the major categories have their front-runners.
12 photos: Oscar nominations
Who got Oscar nominations? "The Revenant," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, led all films with 12 nods, including one for best picture. It will compete against "The Big Short," "Bridge of Spies," "Brooklyn," "Mad Max: Fury Road," "The Martian," "Room" and "Spotlight."

For best picture, it looks like "The Revenant" will take the big prize. The film about a vengeful 1820s trapper has earned good reviews, has had a strong showing at the box office and won the BAFTA for best film. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu won the Directors Guild honor as best director.
Predicting this year's winners
But "The Big Short" and "Spotlight" are also strong possibilities. The latter, about the Boston Globe reporters who broke the story about sexual abuse among Catholic priests, was the front-runner for much of awards season, and its ensemble cast won the SAG Award.
"Revenant's" Leonardo DiCaprio is practically guaranteed to win best actor, and "Room's" Brie Larson is the leader in the best actress category.
