Charles Barkley's mouth landed the former NBA star in the middle of controversy in October. During an interview, the commentator said that he believed successful African-Americans are targeted by "brainwashed" and "uneducated" members of their community.

In the August issue of GQ magazine, Kanye West gave more than a few head-scratching quotes. One of the most perplexing was his stance on what you could call celebrity civil rights: "I talked about the idea of celebrity, and celebrities being treated like blacks were in the '60s, having no rights, and the fact that people can slander your name," he recalled of his wedding toast. Last we checked, celebrities are able to vote and are not barred from using the same public facilities as everyone else, but OK, Kanye.

Kim Kardashian was criticized heavily when she was expecting her first child, North, in 2013, and perhaps a part of her wishes she could've just stayed home.

If you can do it, hide. Never leave the house." Kardashian caught so much blowback from that quote that she later had to tweet that she was joking and that she's learned a new lesson: "I guess you can't be sarcastic when doing interviews!"
