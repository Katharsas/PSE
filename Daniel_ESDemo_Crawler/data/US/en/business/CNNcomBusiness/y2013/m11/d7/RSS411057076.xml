<ExtractedText>Sandra Bullock says blockbuster "Gravity" isn't about gender, but human adversity
Oscar-winning actress was suspended from puppet strings for tough lead role
Would rather spend time with adopted son, than attend glittering Hollywood events
Leading Women connects you to extraordinary women of our time. Each month, we meet two women at the top of their field, exploring their careers, lives and ideas.
London (CNN) -- If ever there was a costume that erased gender, it's got to be an astronaut's suit. Big, bulky, with a uniform shape and reflective mask, it's pretty hard to tell whether the person inside is male, female, or Ham the chimpanzee.
So when Sandra Bullock plays an astronaut hurtling through space in new blockbuster "Gravity," one of the only clues she's even a woman is the sound of her hysterical gasping: "I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"

For 49-year-old Bullock, playing the lead role of Dr Ryan Stone in the thriller which premieres in Britain this week, this is not a female action film -- it's a "human action film."
And if it were up to her, the rest of Hollywood would stop making a distinction between the two.
"There is a female and male in it. The point of view is everyone's point of view, it just so happens that I have a female body and I fortunately got to do the part," she told CNN in an interview at the London Film Festival screening.
"We were very conscious to not make it about the sex -- we made it about the situation and the adversities, rather than 'this is a woman in adversity' or a 'man in adversity.' Anyone can put themselves in my character's situation and feel exactly the same."

Indeed, the infinite blackness of space, and indistinct white uniforms worn by Bullock and co-star George Clooney, create a unique environment not just free from gravity -- but traditional gender cues.
It's quite literally a world away from some of Bullock's best known roles -- the love interest of terrorist-busting cop Keanu Reeves in 1994 thriller "Speed," the tom boy FBI agent turned bombshell in 2000 chick flick "Miss Congeniality," or the executive trying to marry her assistant in 2009 rom-com "The Proposal."
Her 2010 hit "The Blind Side" -- in which she plays a southern mom who adopts a black teenager -- earned her an Academy Award for best actress, also becoming the first film with a sole female lead to take over $200 million at the U.S. box office.
Yet the day before she scored the highest accolade in cinema, Bullock was picking up the Golden Raspberry Award for worst actress in 2010 comedy "All About Steve."
She is one of the few actors to accept the prize in person, revealing a charming ability to not take herself too seriously in a notoriously cutthroat industry.
"They said that nobody went to see this film, but there's over 700 members here and that means the majority of the 700 voted," she joked at the time.
Mom's the word
While Forbes this year named Bullock the most marketable celebrity in the world, with annual earnings of $14 million, it seems her biggest priority right now is not career -- but family.
When it was time for the 2010 Oscar after-party, the best actress-winner instead opted to go home to her newly adopted son Louis -- whom she named after New Orleans jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong, also from her child's hometown.

Academy Award-winning actress Natalie Portman tells CNN she hopes her role as astrophysicist Jane Foster in "Thor: The Dark World" encourages a new generation of female scientists.
The 32-year-old Israeli-born American plays the love interest of Marvel Comics superhero Thor in the Hollywood blockbuster premiering this week. Jane Foster (pictured here) was originally a nurse, but was recast as a scientist for the film.
She's not the first female scientist on the big screen. Here, Jodie Foster plays astrophysicist Ellie Arroway in 1997 film "Contact" -- based on the novel by Carl Sagan.
Sigourney Weaver played zoologist Dian Fossey in the Academy Award nominated film, "Gorillas in the Mist." Real-life naturalist Fossey, originally from Kentucky, studied mountain gorillas in Rwanda as part of her remarkable work.
When Carrie Fisher appeared as Princess Leia in "Star Wars," she showed a generation of young women that Sci-Fi heroes weren't all lazer-blazing men.
