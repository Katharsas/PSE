Uber-like service by 2018
Jonas believes that within the next 18 months, Tesla will share plans for an app-based, on-demand "mobility service." Commercial introduction to this Uber-like service could occur in 2018, with the Model 3 serving as the backbone.
The first version of this service would be human-driven, just like today's other ride hailing services. But then Tesla could move to a model where robots do virtually all the work even though real people sit at the driver's seat just in case it's required.
Jonas predicted Tesla could transition to a fully autonomous service by 2025, that it would have nearly 600,000 cars in its global fleet -- or roughly the same size as Hertz ( HTZ ) today.
"The holy grail of shared mobility is replacing the mistake-prone, fatigued and expensive human driver with a robot that drives with greater accuracy and precision," Jonas wrote.
Tesla faces long odds
All of this sounds pretty out there, right?
Morgan Stanley seems to recognize how extreme its call on Tesla appears. The firm included an "important note" that emphasized the research is based entirely on hypothetical analysis and modeling by its analysts. Neither Musk nor any other Tesla representatives have announced a similar vision.
"We understand the assumptions in this note may seem radical to some investors accustomed to the slow pace of change in a century-old auto business," Jonas wrote.
He acknowledged there are very real risks to this Tesla-dominated future. The biggest include heavy regulation, adoption from skeptical consumers and competition from virtually all other auto makers and several tech companies.
Tesla itself encountered tons of skepticism when it launched the Model S in 2012. Jonas notes that at that time no one had successfully launched an auto company in half a century, but today the Model S is a much desired car with the best overall rating in Consumer Reports' history and is the safest car ever crash tested by NHTSA.
