<ExtractedText>Top 10 U.S. companies to work for
By Katie Lobosco   @KatieLobosco December 10, 2014: 12:29 AM ET
One Google staffer likes working on "stuff that makes people happy."
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
What makes a company great to work for?
Good pay and benefits don't hurt. But when it comes down to it, employees said it's office culture and great colleagues that make these companies satisfying places to work.
Glassdoor asked people about the pros and cons of their employers, and had them rate their company between one and five stars.
More than 800,000 responses were submitted between November 2013 and November 2014. Here are the 10 companies with more than 1,000 employees that ranked the highest:
Google
Sure, the pay is outstanding, but so is the work. "My work is used by lots and lots of users. It's cool stuff that makes people happy," says one Google ( GOOG ) staffer.
Bain &amp; Company
The people are incredible, says one employee. "There's a mix of intelligence but also humility that you don't find at the other top consulting firms."
Nestle Purina PetCare
The company's "strong midwestern roots" make it a great place to work, as do the "vast opportunities that come with an international giant parent company," said one engineer. It is a subsidiary of Nestle based in St. Louis.
F5 Networks
"My skills are getting better, and there is a clear career path for software engineers that don't want to go into management," said one F5 Networks ( FFIV ) software engineer.
Boston Consulting Group
Outstanding colleagues, according to one respondent. "The best and the brightest from all fields and backgrounds (think Rhodes scholars) create a really rich intellectual atmosphere."
Chevron
Employees said they are pleased with the pay, benefits and "excellent" retirement program at Chevron ( CVX ).
HEB
"One of the few companies that actually cares about its employees," said one of the grocery store chain's workers.
In-N-Out Burger
Most fast food workers complain about pay and hours , but In-N-Out Burger bucks the trend. One worker said the chain offers "great pay rates" and "fantastic hours."
McKinsey &amp; Company
The team is a "really amazing set of people" who are "caring, challenging, and whip smart," said one staffer.
Mayo Clinic
A professional work environment, state-of-the-art facilities, and collaboration between departments add up to a great working environment, says a research associate.
