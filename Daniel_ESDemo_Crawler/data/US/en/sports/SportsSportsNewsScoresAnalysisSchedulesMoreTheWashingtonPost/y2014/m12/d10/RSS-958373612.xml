Tempers have started to flare as the Redskins ‘ loss total has reached double digits.
Wide receiver Andre Roberts and cornerback Bashaud Breeland came to blows early in Wednesday’s practice and had to be separated.
The two had been matched up against each other during a 1-on-1 drill that took place within the first 20 minutes of the practice session. Roberts ran a deep route up the right sideline, but Breeland broke up the pass from Colt McCoy. Both Breeland and Roberts fell to the ground at the end of the play, and Breeland got up, then took a knee and then appeared to be grabbing his groin before heading back downfield.
Shortly after, something apparently was said, and Roberts ripped off his helmet, slammed it on the ground and charged toward Breeland and swung at him. Breeland, who saw the wide receiver coming, adjusted his pants and threw up his hands before Roberts made contact, countered with a hay-maker of his own, and then tried to tackle Roberts. Safety Ryan Clark, cornerback E.J. Biggers, safety Phillip Thomas and wide receiver Ryan Grant jumped in to separate the players, as did offensive quality control assistant Jake Peetz. Quarterback Robert Griffin III came over shortly after, trying to help with the peace-making.
Clark continued speaking to Roberts, who shoved the safety away from him. Practice resumed, and shortly after, Breeland covered Grant on another 1-on-1 drill, with no incident ensuing.
