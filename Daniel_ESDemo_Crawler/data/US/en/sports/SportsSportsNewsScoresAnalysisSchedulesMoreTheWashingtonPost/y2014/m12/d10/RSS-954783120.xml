On Saturday, Ohio State “edged” Wisconsin 59-0, emphatically winning a game that had enormous implications for the Buckeyes.
And for one former Badgers player.
J.J. Watt, the Houston Texans defensive end and proud Wisconsin alum, made a bet with Texans teammate John Simon — and paid it off with a look that summed up pretty adequately just how unpalatable the whole thing was.
A deals a deal… @JJWatt found out the hard way. GO BUCKS! pic.twitter.com/10nNzXQa5u

Fortunately for Watt, he can get a little revenge Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts, who have two Ohio State players on offense. Look out, rookie left guard Jack Mewhort and running back Dan Herron.
