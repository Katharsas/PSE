Women’s basketball:Coach Natasha Adair announced the signing of two student-athletes to national letters-of-intent on Wednesday.  Jodi-Marie Ramil and Dionna White will join the squad next season.  Ramil is a 6-foot-2 center from Binghamton, N.Y.; White is a 5-7 guard from Baltimore. 
Swimming and diving: Georgetown defeated Howard, as the men outscored the Bison 162-39 and the women swam to a 136-72 victory in the home opener at McCarthy Pool on Saturday.
Freshman Daniel Ross earned a victory in the mixed 1,000-yard freestyle with a time of 10 minutes 4.48 seconds. He came back later in the day to win the men’s 100 butterfly with a time of 53.80. Senior Casey Bandman won the women’s 100 butterfly with a time of 1:00.08, while junior Nicole Tronolone earned victory in the 100 freestyle with a time of 55.72.
Track and field: The women’s team opened the indoor season at the Navy Lid Lifter on Tuesday at the Wesley Brown Field House in Annapolis. The Hoyas put up a multitude of top performances with both in-season runners as well as unattached competitors, especially in the middle distance events. 
The men's and women's teams will return to competition on Saturday, Jan. 10 with the Father Diamond Invitational, hosted by George Mason.
