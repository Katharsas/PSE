It began with Derrick Rose on Saturday, as the Bulls guard came onto the United Center court for pregame warmups wearing a black shirt with ‘I Can’t Breathe’ spelled out in white letters. LeBron James expressed admiration for Rose’s statement of concern about the Eric Garner case , and on Monday, the Cavaliers’ star, along with teammate Kyrie Irving and several members of the Nets, wore the shirt before a Cleveland-Brooklyn game.
On Tuesday, Kobe Bryant and almost all of the Lakers became the latest group of NBA players to don the shirts, displaying them over their uniforms before a game against the Kings.
— Los Angeles Lakers (@Lakers) December 10, 2014
According to the Associated Press, an “I Can’t Breathe” shirt was distributed to each Laker in the team’s dressing room before the game. All the players except backup center Robert Sacre came out of the dressing room wearing the shirt.
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said on Monday that while he would prefer “for players to abide by our on-court attire rules,” he will not fine any of them for wearing the shirts.
This former editor and part-time writer at The Post is now happy to prove that if you combine 'blowhard' and 'blaggard,' you get 'blogger.' He previously had used 'Desmond Bieler' as his byline, but feels that shortening the first name to 'Des' nicely conveys his ever-decreasing gravitas. He also covers Fantasy Football.
