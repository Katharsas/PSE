A day after Nike announced several minute changes to the uniforms of College Football Playoff participants Alabama, Oregon, Florida State and Ohio State, the Minneapolis-based memorabilia company Jostens unveiled the inaugural CFP championship ring on Wednesday. It’s, um, very shiny.

The bling comes from the “more than 50 cubic zirconias set in Silver Elite, Jostens’ exclusive mix of fine metals,” according to a press release . The ring will also be customized to reflect the team that eventually wins, as well as the College Football Playoff logo.
The design may seem overly gaudy, but put into perspective with other championship rings, many of which were also designed by Jostens, it suddenly looks understated. For instance, look at last year’s, won by FSU.
It's a big day for @FSU_Football – they received 3 #Jostens champ rings to commemorate their National Championship! pic.twitter.com/EyhjdUE4KA

Then there’s been these professional team victory rings.
Thrilled for @SportingKC and their #MLS championship rings! Congrats, guys and best of luck in the new season! pic.twitter.com/kscJgBWSCY
