Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers fired a mild little shot at Detroit Lions linebacker Stephen Tulloch over the embarrassing, oft-GIFed way in which his NFL season ended in a discount-doublecheck move gone wrong.
“I just wanted to remind people you can do that celebration and not hurt yourself,” Rodgers said Tuesday on his radio show on 540 ESPN Radio Milwaukee . “It wasn’t even really a big one. It was just a little one.”
Tulloch tore his anterior cruciate ligament doing Rodgers’ State Farm move after sacking the quarterback in a Sept. 21 victory over Green Bay. Evidently, Tulloch’s knee is healing faster than his ego.
First off I wasn't doing the discount double check when I got hurt. So my man A Rod can’t stop promoting his discount double move.

9 years and one small setback.If you followed my career you know, I'll be back better then ever. I've beaten bigger odds than this in life.

Much respect to A Rod, great player. I'll leave it at that.

Maybe Rodgers can remind the Lions again about the move, since the teams close out the season against each other.
