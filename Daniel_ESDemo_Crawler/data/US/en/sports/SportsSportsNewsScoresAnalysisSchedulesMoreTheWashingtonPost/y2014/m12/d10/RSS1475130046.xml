The  Redskins announced that they have signed cornerback Justin Rogers to their 53-man roster.
A fourth-year veteran out of Richmond, Rogers entered the league in 2011 as a seventh-round pick of the Buffalo Bills. Rogers spent two seasons with the Bills before spending brief stints with the Texans and Dolphins. He spent a portion of this offseason with the Chiefs, but was cut before the start of the season and had yet to land a job with another team.
For his career, the 5-foot-11, 180-pound Rogers has appeared in 39 games, starting seven, recording 64 tackles, three interceptions and one forced fumble.
The Redskins had a roster opening after cutting linebackers Everette Brown, Steve Beauharnais and cornerback Greg Ducre on Tuesday.
