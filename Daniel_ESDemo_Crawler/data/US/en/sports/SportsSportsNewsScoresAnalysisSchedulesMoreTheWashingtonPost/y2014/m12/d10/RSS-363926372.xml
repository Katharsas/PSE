Virginia defensive end Eli Harold announced on his Twitter account Wednesday that he will forgo his final year of eligibility and declare for the 2015 NFL draft.
Harold was one of the first high-profile recruits to commit to the Cavaliers after Coach Mike London’s hiring in 2010, and he lived up to that promise during a prolific junior campaign this fall. The Virginia Beach native earned second team all-ACC honors from the league’s media and coaches after finishing with seven sacks and 14.5 tackles for losses, third-most in the ACC.
“To all UVA Fans, my family, and my close friends and teammates it’s been a great ride,” Harold wrote on Twitter . “I have decided to enter the NFL Draft.”
Losing Harold is a significant blow for Virginia’s defense, which will also have to replace seniors Anthony Harris and linebackers Henry Coley and DaQuan Romero next year. ESPN’s Mel Kiper Jr. had Harold rated as the No. 6 defensive end on his most recent NFL draft board last month.
But the Cavaliers received some good news Wednesday. Linebacker-defensive end Max Valles, who ranked second in the ACC with nine sacks this past season, announced on his Twitter account that he would be returning to Virginia next year, contrary to an earlier report that indicated he would join Harold in declaring early for the NFL draft.
