In its push to become the U.S. Olympic Committee’s choice as its 2024 Summer Games candidate city over contenders Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the D.C. 2024 bid movement released a video Tuesday touting the unity “in this town.”
“In this town, we have learned that no one of us is as good as we are together,” the video begins.
The video features politicians from D.C., Maryland and Virginia, including U.S. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), former House speaker Newt Gingrich, U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine (both Virginia Democrats). It also features local residents doing the unity hand symbol ( more or less correctly ), Capitals defenseman John Carlson and Wizards players John Wall, Otto Porter and Bradley Beal. Capitals and Wizards owner Ted Leonsis is vice chairman of the D.C. bid.
The USOC board will meet on Dec. 16 to decide whether to bid on the 2024 Games after listening to presentations from all four cities. The AP reports that the USOC could announce its candidate city immediately following those presentations or wait until 2015.
