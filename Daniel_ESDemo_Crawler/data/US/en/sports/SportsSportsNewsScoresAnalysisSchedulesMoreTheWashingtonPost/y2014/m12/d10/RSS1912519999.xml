Everything’s coming up Johnny Football. Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel reportedly found out Tuesday that he will get his first NFL start on Sunday, this after celebrating his 22nd birthday on Saturday. We don’t know exactly what Manziel did for his birthday, although it seems unlikely even for him that he made another  trip to Las Vegas , as he did for his all-important 21st (when he also had a little more free time).
However, we do know what kind of cake Manziel enjoyed for his 22nd, and it is everything you’d expect from a guy who flashes a “money” sign after every touchdown:
Cleveland bakery Colossal Cupcakes posted that image to Instagram, proudly displaying an edible edifice that would have Scrooge McDuck diving into it. According to Busted Coverage , the cake took two days to make; the money was made of chocolate, and the bags were created out of double chocolate fudge cake.
TMZ Sports  (go figure) offers some more details: the cake weighed a whopping 45 pounds and cost $600. Some of Manziel’s buddies ordered the cake for him — they know him so well!
Now Manziel has a chance to prove that all the money, not to mention time, energy and premium draft pick , that the Browns invested in him was worth it.
This former editor and part-time writer at The Post is now happy to prove that if you combine 'blowhard' and 'blaggard,' you get 'blogger.' He previously had used 'Desmond Bieler' as his byline, but feels that shortening the first name to 'Des' nicely conveys his ever-decreasing gravitas. He also covers Fantasy Football.
