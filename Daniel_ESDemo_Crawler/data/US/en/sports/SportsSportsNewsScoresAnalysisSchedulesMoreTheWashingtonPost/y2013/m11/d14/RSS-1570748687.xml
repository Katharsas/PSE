Virginia Tech’s Dadi Nicolas, Luther Maddy
DON PETERSEN/AP - Virginia Tech’s Luther Maddy, show here taking down Duke quarterback Anthony Boone on Oct. 26, has 6.5 sacks entering Saturday’s game against Maryland.
By Mark Giannotto, E-mail the writer
BLACKSBURG, Va. — Virginia Tech defensive end Dadi Nicolas rubbed his hands together as he contemplated the question. Why did he wait until his senior year of high school before trying out for the football team? One moment stood out above all.
He was in English class, struggling to come up with a thesis for an assignment about his future plans. He thought back to the chance he had received after his birth in Haiti, when the woman who raised his biological mother adopted him and brought him to Delray Beach, Fla., at three months old. It triggered a series of life-altering questions.

Best news photos of the week
A quick way to catch up on the week’s news through our favorite photos.
“What am I doing with my life? After high school, how am I gonna go to college?” Nicolas recalled last week. “It was just that day forward, I needed to make something happen. I had to reevaluate my life and do some growing up. I knew my mom wasn’t going to be able to afford an education for me.”
Hokies defensive tackle Luther Maddy nodded in agreement as his roommate finished the story.
Like Nicolas, his classmate at Atlantic High in Delray Beach, he hadn’t taken football seriously and wasn’t a starter on the team until his senior year. But after overhearing a phone call between his parents and relatives in Haiti about money one night, Maddy wanted to help out.
“God spoke to me and said, ‘You’ve got an opportunity with this football stuff,’ ” he said.
More than four years after separate football reawakenings, their similar backgrounds have led to a bond unlike any other on the Hokies’ football team.
“We’ve been through a lot, faced the same difficulties,” Maddy said. “I feel like we’re blood brothers now.”
Under the radar
Delray Beach, about 50 miles north of Miami, is home to one of the largest Haitian populations in the country, but Maddy and Nicolas were not especially close growing up even though their recruitment went hand in hand.
The two burst onto the scene together as seniors, with Nicolas tallying 70 tackles and 11 sacks in his first season of organized high school football and Maddy racking up 13 sacks. It was Nicolas, though, who initially drew the interest of college coaches, and he orally committed to Minnesota over scholarship offers from Kansas, Florida Atlantic and Western Michigan.
But Atlantic High Coach Chris Bean insisted that Virginia Tech defensive line coach Charley Wiles and Coach Frank Beamer watch film on Nicolas and Maddy while they were in South Florida to visit another recruit in January 2011. Wiles trusted Bean because Atlantic High products such as cornerbacks Jayron Hosley and Brandon Flowers and wide receiver David Clowney all had strong careers at Virginia Tech and ended up in the NFL.
Once Wiles put on the film of Nicolas, he quickly realized he may have stumbled upon a prospect with many of the same natural pass-rushing skills associated with New York Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, another Haitian American from South Florida who took to football later than most.
“It’s just another story in recruiting, how . . . there’s no real science,” Wiles said. “You got to go on guys that you know in the business, that you trust in the business. . . . We haven’t had a dud out of [Atlantic] ever.”
