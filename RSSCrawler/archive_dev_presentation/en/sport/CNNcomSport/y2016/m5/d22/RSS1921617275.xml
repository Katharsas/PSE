Could Formula E be heading to the Big Apple in 2017?

It's starting to sound like the schedule for fashion week not a motorsport world championship.
Last year it was London, this year it's been Paris and next year, if Formula E gets its wish, New York will feature on the race calendar for the first time.
The Big Apple has long been eyed as a potential venue for the electric car series, and CEO Alejandro Agag is "very optimistic" about the chances of staging a historic race on its streets.
"We have two or three very exciting surprises for the end of the season," Agag told CNN's Supercharged show.
"I've just come from New York looking at different venues, different possibilities. It's far from done yet but we are very optimistic. Our dream would be to have a race in New York."

Formula E cars could be racing on the streets of New York City in 2017.
The prospect of a new race for next season is a boost after the disappointment of having to cancel next month's Moscow ePrix in Russia, which was scheduled to host round nine of the 2015-16 championship.
"The Moscow authorities have been extremely cooperative with us but on that date there were so many things going on around the venue we wanted, right next to the Kremlin, that we had to take the decision to postpone the race -- but Moscow will happen in the future," Agag said.

This weekend, the drivers will battle on the streets of Berlin, racing along Karl-Marx-Allee and around Strausberger Platz.
With three races remaining, the drivers' championship is finely poised with ABT Schaeffler's Lucas di Grassi holding a slender 11-point lead over Renault e.Dams driver Sebastian Buemi.

Racing in the heart of Berlin – "Berlin is great," says Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag. "We are subject to so many circumstances. The refugee crisis had the consequence that the government of Berlin placed all the refugees in Templehoff airport -- where we were racing (in 2015) -- so we had to look for a new location in the city."
