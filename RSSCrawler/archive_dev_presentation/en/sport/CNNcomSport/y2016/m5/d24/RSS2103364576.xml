<description>It's the only grand slam missing from world No.1 Novak Djokovic's glittering CV -- but tennis great Pat Cash has tipped the Serbian to complete the set by winning the French Open this month.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Popular: &lt;a href="http://podcast.cnn.com/fareed-zakaria-gps/episode/all/OpOyMGVuuMe3mU/fq6sf4.1-1.html" target="_blank"&gt;Radical Islam in America&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://podcast.cnn.com/the-axe-files-david-axelrod/episode/all/0Q3HRwVTAOXOgB/wgry7g.64k.html" target="_blank"&gt;Graham Opposes Republican Leader&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://podcast.cnn.com/anderson-cooper-360/episode/all/065F3vnWEzaATm/ac360-special-2016-01-07.html" target="_blank"&gt;Guns in America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;</description>

Cash said he believed defending champion Stanislas Wawrinka -- who beat Djokovic to win last year's title and faces a potential semifinal against second seed Andy Murray -- could repeat his success.
"He's a big, strong guy who never runs out of steam," the former Wimbledon champion added. "If he gets through the first week he will be very, very dangerous in the second, and you would not want to see his name next to yours.
"He's the most powerful player on the circuit. His backhand is perfection, and he has a massive serve. What's more, he's got a good record against Murray and likes playing him."
The French Open, however, will take place without all-time great Roger Federer, who ruled himself out with a back problem Thursday.

Federer's run of 65 straight majors came to an end when he announced on his Facebook page: "I regret to announce that I have made the decision not to play in this year's French Open.
"This decision was not easy to make, but I took it to ensure I could play the remainder of the season and help to extend the rest of my career."
Cash said: "He's 34 now, and at an age where he is going to get more injuries. This, realistically, was not a tournament he was going to win, and I think he will now get to Wimbledon early and start doing some hitting on the grass courts.
"Sadly, the hands of time stop for nobody."
