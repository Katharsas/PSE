Fiji retains overall series title
Twickenham, London (CNN)
Collins Injera became the leading try scorer in rugby sevens on Saturday, and it was a family celebration for the Kenya star.
Injera crossed the line four times on the opening day of the final round of the 2015-16 Sevens World Series in London, taking him past the previous record of 230 set by Argentina's Santiago Gomez Cora.
He had much reason to thank older brother Humphrey Kayange, who set him up for his 231st try in the dying seconds of Kenya's 29-12 defeat by France.

Injera sank to his knees and looked to the gray skies above Twickenham, before running off the field to celebrate with his parents watching proudly in the stands.
"I've played this sport since high school, and when I started out I wanted to go for the record," the 29-year-old said pitchside after the game.

"It was a huge thing -- getting it with my brother, who was mentoring me a lot, telling me what to do and what not to do. It's a special moment for me, happening at Twickenham."
Injera scored his first series try at the home of English rugby -- and his 200th there last year when he famously celebrated the milestone by signing a TV camera, ruining its lens in the process.
Injera said he had a "special connection" with his older brother -- who also gifted him a score when already over the try line in the earlier loss to Scotland.
"I want to thank him for that, it was a selfless thing to do," he told CNN. "Every time I just found myself supporting him. We just have this connection -- there was no argument that he had to give me the try."
