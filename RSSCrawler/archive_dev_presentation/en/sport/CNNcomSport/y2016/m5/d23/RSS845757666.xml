An emotional Rory McIIroy snapped a six-month winless drought by claiming the Irish Open for the first time Sunday, fulfilling a lifetime ambition.
McIlroy has never won his home open and missed the cut on the last three stagings, but inspired play insured he would land the trophy at an event he hosts for his foundation.
Scotsman Russell Knox had taken a one-shot lead from longtime pacesetter McIlroy with three holes to play until the four-time major winner unleashed his magic.

Sensational approach shots to the par-five 16th and 18th at the K Club secured him a birdie and closing eagle.
He also lipped out a birdie putt on the 17th as Knox faded to three shots behind at the end, tied second with Welshman Bradley Dredge.

As he approached the final green, with victory in the bag, McIlroy was visibly moved before tapping in the shortest of eagle putts.
"I don't really get emotional when I win, but I was holding back the tears there. To play like that and finish like that, with all of my friends and family watching was just so special," the Northern Ireland star admitted.
