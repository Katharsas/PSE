<ExtractedText>America's Cup racing returns to NYC
Last held off Manhattan in 1920
Thomas Lipton most persistent challenger
Tea baron spent millions over three decades
(CNN)
The last time the America's Cup was held in New York, Woodrow Wilson was President and large wooden sailing yachts raced each other calmly across the water at a sedate 20 miles per hour.
This weekend, for the first time since Irish-Scottish tea baron Thomas Lipton lost the 1920 race to a New York Yacht Club syndicate led by railroad tycoon and art collector Henry Walters, the city will play host to the world's most famous boat race when the Louis Vuitton America's Cup World Series sails into town.
Instead of elegant yachts, the six teams competing in the Louis Vuitton World Cup series ahead of next year's America's Cup in Bermuda will face off in carbon-fiber catamarans that look like jet airplanes, capable of going up to 40 miles per hour.
The boats may have changed beyond recognition but one thing has remained the same in the 165-year history of the America's Cup -- its allure for the world's wealthiest people and power brokers.
Merchant and yachtsman Sir Thomas Johnstone Lipton (1848-1931) started the Lipton tea company.
"The people who are attracted to the America's Cup are the people who are attracted to competition at any level, at any time," America's Cup historian and sailing author John Rousmaniere said in a phone interview from New York. "And Sir Thomas Lipton was at the top of the heap."

The current Cup holder is U.S. billionaire Larry Ellison, co-founder of software giant Oracle. He'll be up against five challengers including Olympic sailing legend Ben Ainslie, who next year hopes to be Britain's first victor since sailing's premier event began in 1851.
Lipton, a self-made man who was born into poverty in Glasgow, was the most persistent challenger in the America's Cup, plowing millions of dollars into five campaigns between 1899 and 1930 through the Royal Ulster Yacht Club. But all of his Shamrock boats were defeated, endearing him to the American public as a "folk hero" and "lovable loser" according to the event website.
Henry Walters' Resolute syndicate won the last series held in NYC.
Lipton wasn't the only illustrious name involved in the America's Cup at the turn of the last century. U.S. financier John Pierpont Morgan co-owned the 1899 and 1901 Cup winner Columbia, while the Vanderbilt family, whose wealth came from railroads and shipping, helped fund three Cup winners between 1895 and 1937.
The closest Lipton came to winning was in 1920, when Shamrock IV took the first two races before Resolute won the next three to retain the trophy for the New York Yacht Club.
That series was highly anticipated across North America, with New York hotels having to turn people away because they were at full capacity, while special trains brought in spectators from Canada, the New York Times reported on July 15, 1920.
"Resolute Wins Final Race By 19 Minutes 45 Seconds; America's Cup Stays Here," headlined the Richmond Times-Dispatch on July 28, 1920.
Lipton's relentless pursuit of success helped put the event on the map in the U.S., Bob Fisher, a sailing historian and author of numerous books on the sport, said by phone from Lymington on the English south coast.
"He was much loved by America and the Americans," Fisher said. "He was persistent, he wanted to win the Cup and spent a lot of money doing so."
Thomas Sopwith's Endeavour was the next UK challenger in 1934, but was also beaten.
Lipton may have spent as much as $2 million on his two challenges in 1920 and 1930, Rousmaniere estimated. That's roughly $27 million in today's money .
Born in 1848, Thomas Johnstone Lipton became interested in the sport when he persuaded his parents to let him sail to New York from Scotland when he was just 14 years old, according to the America's Cup Hall of Fame website.
While in the U.S., he learned about the grocery trade and the power of advertising. Lipton returned home to his parents in Scotland five years later.
By 1914, he'd expanded the family's grocery shop into 500 stores -- laying the foundation for the nation's first supermarket chain. He also created the Lipton tea brand, which is still in existence today.
