<description>In sci-fi movies, space habitats are huge structures with labyrinth layouts. But Hollywood doesn't have to deal with the issues real aerospace engineers face when contemplating future space homes -- such as gravity and financial constraints. </description>

Go inside a future space home 01:06
Bigelow knows that all eyes are on the performance of his module. During the test period, NASA will be paying close attention to the structural integrity of the BEAM module. These expendables need to be just as strong, if not stronger than, their metal counterparts. Bigelow is tight-lipped about the proprietary material from which the modules are made, but he told CNN that they include many layers of Kevlar-like materials and are incredibly strong.
"It's a multiple-layered structure, and when something hits the first outer layer, it fractures and breaks up," he says.
Astronauts will enter BEAM every few months to evaluate and monitor things such as temperature, pressure and radiation sensors. It will be the first time an astronaut has stepped foot in an expandable habitat in space. If the module performs well, inflatables could play a critical role in the future of space exploration.
"We would like to be part of the process of establishing a lunar station and other kinds of space outposts -- maybe someday helping to support Mars ambitions," Bigelow says.
A long road
NASA was into the benefits of expandable technology long before Bigelow arrived on the space scene.
Echo 1, an inflatable device, launched in 1960. But it took some time until soft structures were strong enough to be considered for crewed operations.
In the 1990s, NASA started working on a design concept for an inflatable living quarter for a manned mission to Mars. The program was called TransHab, but it never got beyond ground testing because the space agency abandoned it in 2000.
Bigelow licensed and further developed the technology that was developed during the TransHab program. In 2006 and 2007, Bigelow launched Genesis 1 and 2 , showing that the expansion and launching systems could work.
Deep Space habitats
Bigelow's expandable habitats have only been tested in low-Earth orbit -- between 85 miles (137 kilometers) and 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) in altitude -- but NASA's Crusan says he thinks they will play a role in future journeys to deep space.
"These habitats are essential to executing our overall Mars endeavors," he says.
Yet the habitats that will bring humans to deep space will be considerably different from what has been seen.
"To date we've thought about habitats as stations," Crusan says. "All of our habitats in the future ... will also have propulsion with the engines to take us to our destinations."
Which brings us back to the issue of size.
"The heavier something is, the harder it's going to be to move around the solar system," Crusan says.
The International Space Station has the volume of a six-bedroom house, and, according to NASA, it's three to four times the volume needed to send four astronauts to and from Mars.
Bigelow Aerospace isn't the only name in the space habitat industry. NextSTEP, NASA's primary funding program for commercial industries, has contracts with Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK to develop designs for space habitats.
NASA plans to invest $65 million in commercial industries in the next 14 months. It also intends to spend more than $50 million internally this year on such things as life support systems, radiation protection and logistics management -- all of which need to be considered when sending humans to live in space.
