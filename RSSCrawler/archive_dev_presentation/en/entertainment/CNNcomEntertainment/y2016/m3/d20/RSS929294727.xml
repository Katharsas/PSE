Controversial song lyrics – Prince's song "Darling Nikki" was about a young lady who did something ... naughty with a magazine. According to Time Magazine, the song's lyrics inspired wife of then Sen. Al Gore, Tipper Gore, to found the Parents Music Resource Center, which led to "Parental Advisory" labels on albums. So thanks for that, Prince. The Purple One announced in March 2016 that he'd be releasing a memoir--perhaps it will also include some titillating passages.
