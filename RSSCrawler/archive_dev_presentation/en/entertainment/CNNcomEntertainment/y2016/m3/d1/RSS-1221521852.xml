Oscars 2016: Seven big moments you're talking about
Updated 1518 GMT (2318 HKT) February 29, 2016

Story highlights
88th Annual Academy Awards had some memorable moments
With controversy around the awards and Chris Rock hosting, this was somewhat expected
(CNN)
With controversy surrounding this year's Oscars, and take-no-prisoners comic Chris Rock as host, most expected it to be a memorable show, and it certainly delivered on those terms.
Starting with Rock's monologue that gave a new meaning to the term "he went there," there were many moments that got a lot of attention on social media.
#OscarsSoWhite and diversity themes dominated the show
It didn't end with Rock's monologue. Many of the jokes during the night focused on the #OscarsSoWhite issue: from a sketch of black actors being inserted into the nominated films, to Rock revisiting his 2005 hosting segment when he visited a theater in Compton to speak to moviegoers there.
The jokes that fell flat

Chris Rock generally got a lot of laughs -- even if some of them were uncomfortable -- but a couple of gags just didn't work for the audience.
Rock shocked everyone by bringing out actress Stacey Dash -- who recently criticized the #OscarsSoWhite movement as well as Black History Month -- to say a few words as the "director of diversity outreach." The audience was apparently so stunned that it barely elicited a reaction.

Dash herself explained the situation in her blog: "When they added ME to increase the diversity, I'm sure many black people rolled their eyes. I'm not 'black enough,' they say. But guess what? I've heard that all my life. I would rather be a free thinking, black than a cookie cutter black who thinks -- and votes -- just like all my friends."
Then there was the umpteenth joke about "The Revenant's" bear, with someone in a bear suit applauding the movie when it had its best picture nominee montage. The camera cut to Leonardo DiCaprio who was stone faced.

The Onion didn't let it go though.

Kevin Hart was everywhere
Not only did Hart get a shout-out in Rock's monologue, he kept getting referred to throughout, to the point where he looked like a future host.
"How come it's only unemployed people who tell you to quit something?... The last thing I need is to lose another job to Kevin Hart."

Kevin Hart joke. *marks #Oscars bingo card*
— Entertainment Weekly (@EW) February 29, 2016
He presented an award himself, but had something important to say, paying tribute to actors of color who weren't nominated.

Another of Rock's comedian friends made a few appearances ... but only backstage: Dave Chappelle.

Censored moments
Hart ( not Rock, as some predicted) was bleeped in the midst of congratulating black actors in the aforementioned remarks (though it's unknown if he said more than just that: the show was on a delay).
Earlier, Oscar-winning "Mad Max: Fury Road" sound editor Mark Mangini dropped an F-bomb before his speech, making for two censored moments this year.

And then there were the moments they couldn't censor.

Reactions to the red carpet
Before winning an Oscar, Alicia Vikander won the Internet with a dress that reminded everyone of Belle's from "Beauty and the Beast."

Purple was one of the popular colors this year, so popular that Reese Witherspoon's and Tina Fey's dresses looked almost the same.

As always, Jared Leto's quirky sensibility shone through, with a bowtie that resembled a rose.

If anything the biggest red carpet misstep wasn't on the red carpet at all, but when the account @TotalBeauty mistook Whoopi Goldberg for Oprah Winfrey. They apologized shortly afterward.
