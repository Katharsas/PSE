In January 1944, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association -- formed a month earlier by eight international entertainment correspondents -- held the first Golden Globe Awards. The best actress award went to a 24-year-old performer, Jennifer Jones, for her performance in the year's best film winner, "The Song of Bernadette." The Globes -- this year's arrive Sunday -- have gone on to become one of the biggest honors in the entertainment world. And Jennifer Jones? She had quite a career herself. Here are the other roles she was nominated for.

"The Song of Bernadette," about the 19th-century saint who had visions of the Virgin Mary at Lourdes, made Jones a star overnight. In addition to winning the Golden Globe, she also won the best actress Oscar. But stardom didn't make for happiness. Jones' marriage to fellow performer Robert Walker crumbled, even as the two made 1944's wartime drama "Since You Went Away." Jones started an affair with producer David O. Selznick, who had signed her in 1941. The film did earn Jones another Oscar nomination, however.

Jones' next film was 1945's "Love Letters," a romantic mystery with co-star Joseph Cotten and a screenplay by Ayn Rand. Though panned by critics, the film was another hit and garnered Jones her third Oscar nomination.

Selznick's infatuation with Jones, whom he married in 1949, perhaps peaked on screen with 1946's "Duel in the Sun," a mammoth Western directed by King Vidor. Jones, playing a part-Native American woman caught between two wealthy sons, was top-billed over Gregory Peck, shown here, and Cotten. Selznick, who produced "Gone With the Wind," wanted "Duel" to measure up to the 1939 classic, but it fell short. Nevertheless, Jones was nominated for yet another Oscar.

In 1955's "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing," Jones was paired with William Holden. She plays a doctor of Asian ancestry who falls in love with a reporter in late-'40s China. Another Oscar nomination followed.
