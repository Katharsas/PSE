<ExtractedText>Golden Globes 2016: The winners list
The best supporting actress prize went to Kate Winslet for "Steve Jobs," Danny Boyle's portrait of the late Apple co-founder. Winslet played Apple marketing exec Joanna Hoffman, a member of Jobs' inner circle and one of the few people at the company who stood up to his famous bullying.
"Steve Jobs" also was named best screenplay for Aaron Sorkin's talky script, a surprising show of strength for a film that tanked at the box office and has faded somewhat as a top Oscar contender.
As expected, Pixar's critical and commercial smash "Inside Out," about the emotions fighting for control of an 11-year-old girl, won best animated movie.
Best foreign film went to "Son of Saul," a Holocaust drama from Hungary about an Auschwitz concentration camp prisoner trying to give a proper burial to his son.
New blood on TV
Jon Hamm, on the heels of his first Emmy win in November, won best actor in a TV drama for his defining role as the tormented, womanizing Don Draper in AMC's "Mad Men," which wrapped its final season last year.
But unpredictability was the rule in most of the TV categories, as new or lesser-known series beat out more established shows for many awards. Globe voters honored such prestige networks and streaming services as HBO, AMC and Amazon but also recognized shows from the CW, FX and the USA Network.
Amazon's "Mozart in the Jungle," about classical musicians in New York, was named best TV comedy. The category had been considered a three-way race between Amazon's transgender dramedy, "Transparent"; Netflix's ensemble prison saga, "Orange is the New Black"; and HBO's political satire, "Veep."
"Mozart's" star, Gael Garcia Bernal, also won best actor in a TV comedy.
Best TV drama went to the upstart "Mr. Robot," USA Network's critically praised hacker drama, which beat out such heavyweights as Fox's "Empire" and HBO's "Game of Thrones." Christian Slater won best supporting actor in a TV series for his role as an anarchist on the show.
In another mild surprise, Rachel Bloom won best actress in a TV comedy for "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend," which premiered on the CW in October. "Veep's" Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who has won numerous awards for her starring role on the show, had been considered the front-runner.
Taraji P. Henson won best actress in a TV drama for her larger-than-life role as Cookie, the tough matriarch of a family-run record label, on "Empire." As a reference to her character, Henson handed out cookies in the ballroom on her way to the stage.
Best supporting actress in a TV series went to Maura Tierney for Showtime's "The Affair," in which she plays a middle-age woman who learns that her husband is cheating on her.
Two pop stars also were honored Sunday. Lady Gaga won best actress in a limited TV series for her role as a vampire on FX's "American Horror Story: Hotel." And crooner Sam Smith accepted the award for best song for "Writing's On the Wall," his theme song from the James Bond movie "Spectre."
Best miniseries or TV movie went to "Wolf Hall," the BBC drama about political machinations among England's Tudor dynasty during the reign of King Henry VIII. Oscar Isaac, currently co-starring as a rebel fighter pilot in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," won best actor in a TV miniseries for his role as a mayor who fought for the desegregation of public housing in HBO's "Show Me a Hero."
Host Ricky Gervais kicked off the night with a beer in his hand and a typically bitchy monologue in which he made jokes at the expense of Caitlyn Jenner, "Transparent" nominee Jeffrey Tambor, movie bomb "Pixels" and host network NBC, which didn't receive any Globe nominations.
