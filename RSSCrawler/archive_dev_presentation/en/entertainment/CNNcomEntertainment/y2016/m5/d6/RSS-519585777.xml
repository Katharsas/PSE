Since portraying sharp witch Hermione in the "Harry Potter" series, Emma Watson has broken away from the supernatural with roles grounded in the (mostly) real world. After "My Week With Marilyn," "The Perks of Being A Wallflower" and "The Bling Ring," she showed her sense of humor in Seth Rogen's outlandish summer comedy "This Is the End." She announced in February that she's taking a break from acting .

Just enough time has passed for us to stop cringing at the sight of Tom Felton, who came to be known as the weakling bully Draco Malfoy. Even while working on the "Potter" franchise, Felton dabbled in other films, like "The Disappeared" and "Get Him to the Greek." Felton has been busy since "Potter" wrapped, and he appeared in the World War II movie "Ghosts of the Pacific" and the TNT cop drama "Murder in the First."

"Even if I'm too old to play Luna, can I go through 10 hours prosthetics to play a crumple-horned-snorkack. Please??"

Devon Murray's Seamus Finnigan was an easy character to love, and fans have missed seeing Murray (and hearing his accent) on the big screen. Murray has not appeared in movies since the last Potter film but assured a supporter from his unverified Twitter account in September 2013 that he's "been offered a lead role in a new movie so could be seeing my mug soon :)"
