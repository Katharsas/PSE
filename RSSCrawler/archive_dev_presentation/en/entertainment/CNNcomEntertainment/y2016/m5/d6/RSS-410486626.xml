The study found that Mercury, who died in 1991 from AIDS-related complications, was a master at modulating his voice. The findings included evidence that Mercury was using "subharmonics" by vibrating his ventricular folds, a technique usually found only in Tuvan throat singers.

"Perceptually, Freddie Mercury's irregular (and typically faster) vibrato is clearly audible in the sustained notes of famous songs such as 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (A Night at the Opera) or 'We Are the Champions' (News of the World), and it appears to be one of the hallmarks of his vocal style," the study says.
The research comes on the heels of the news that a notebook belonging to Mercury, filled with lyrics to 19 songs, is set to go to auction in June.
