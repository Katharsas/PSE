Ronan Farrow was formerly known as "Satchel" and was believed to be the biological son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen. His mother cast doubt on that in 2013 when she revealed that his father could be her former husband Frank Sinatra, to which Ronan quipped on Twitter, "Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son."
