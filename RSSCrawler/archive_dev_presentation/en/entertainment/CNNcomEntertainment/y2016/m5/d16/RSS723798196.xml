(CNN)
Police in a Chicago suburb called off their search Monday for singer-songwriter Sinead O'Connor after she was found safe.
Officer Fred King of the Wilmette, Illinois, Police Department told CNN that O'Connor was located Monday after being missing for more than a day. An unnamed caller had alerted authorities that the singer had not returned from a bike ride early Sunday morning.
Police didn't offer any details about where O'Connor had been or how they located her.
"The Wilmette Police is seeking to check the well-being of Sinead O'Connor," said an earlier press release from the desk of Wilmette Police Sgt. Michael Robinson. "O'Connor reportedly left the Wilmette area for a bicycle ride yesterday at 6:00 AM and has not returned. A caller has expressed concern for her well-being and no other information is available at this time."
The Irish-born singer, who became a global star in 1990 with her Prince-penned hit, "Nothing Compares 2 U," has had her fair share of troubles in recent years.

Earlier this month former late-night host Arsenio Hall filed suit against her for $5 million, claiming defamation after she accused him of supplying Prince with drugs "over the decades" and of drugging her.
