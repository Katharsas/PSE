Cooke won more than a half dozen Eisner Awards, which are held annually during San Diego Comic-Con. It is the highest honor anyone in the comic book industry can receive.
Cooke wasn't content with success only in the superhero genre.
In 2012, he spoke with CNN regarding stylish graphic novels about Parker, a single-named anti-hero of the 1960s. Parker, a hired gun and professional thief, made his debut in 1962 in Richard Stark's "The Hunter."  Stark was a pseudonym of the late Donald Westlake.
Cooke described his adaptations as being like noir movies on paper. Concerning his book "The Score," he said the work was intense and exacting, taking notes, laying out the design and adjusting the order of the scenes.
Months were spent at the table, crafting the novel.
"When I work on Parker, that's all I do. I just immerse myself in it," Cooke told CNN.
