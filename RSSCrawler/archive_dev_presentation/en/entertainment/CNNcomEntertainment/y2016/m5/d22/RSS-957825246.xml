A Tupac fan will be starin' through the rear view of the slain rapper's fully loaded Hummer H1 after paying well above a quarter-million dollars.
Shakur's customized off-road vehicle, bought by the hip-hop artist only three months before he died in 1996, was sold at auction Thursday for $337,114, according to Boston-based RR Auction.
Shakur personally customized the vehicle, which is equipped with a 6.5-liter, turbo diesel V-8 engine with automatic transmission. The odometer read 10,101 miles at the time of the sale.
The colossal Hummer boasts off-road lights, a 360-degree spotlight, a grille guard, diamond-plate bumpers, oversized off-road wheels and tires, and an external PA system with three sirens, according to RR Auction.
Tupac Shakur died in September 1996, six days after being shot in Las Vegas.
The interior is trimmed in burl wood with beige leather upholstery, and is fit with a 12-disc Clarion sound system, Sony GPS and a central tire inflation system.

The auction winner is a Tupac fan and collector from the Midwest who wishes to remain anonymous, RR Auction said.
Shakur was shot multiple times on September 7, 1996, after leaving a boxing match with the then-CEO of Death Row Records, Suge Knight.
Shakur died six days later at age 25. The drive-by killing has not been solved.
"It's an incredible piece of hip-hop history that evokes the invincible spirit of one of rap's true lyrical giants," said Robert Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction. "We are thrilled at the price achieved and with the continued success of our specialty themed auctions."
After Shakur's death, the Hummer had several owners, including his late mother Afeni Shakur Davis.
