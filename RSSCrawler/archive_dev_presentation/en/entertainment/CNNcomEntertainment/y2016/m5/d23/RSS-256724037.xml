Audrina Patridge on 'The Hills' fake romances
Updated 1642 GMT (0042 HKT) May 23, 2016
Audrina Patridge now says she doesn't think "The Hills" would work in the age of social media.
(CNN)
Audrina Patridge has come a long way since "The Hills."
Currently expecting her first child, Patridge is revealing just how much producers of her MTV reality show manipulated things behind the scenes. She told Us Weekly that her dating Spencer Pratt was completely staged.
"I did not have history with him and this was one of the things that really upset me and this was when I started distrusting the producers," she said.
Patridge said the show made it difficult to actually date someone in real life, as was the case with cast mate Justin Bobby who she had an on-again, off-again romance with while on the show.
She said producers manufactured drama by having cast member Kristin Cavallari date Bobby after he and Patridge were over.

"Yeah, it was really weird for everyone and then it just wasn't genuine," Patridge said. "And then whenever the producers kept wanting me to fight with her over him, I was like, 'I'm not doing that! I'm not even with him! I'm with someone else!' It really was hard with my real life and then my TV life."
"You can't have a real relationship on that show," she added. "The Hills, any real relationship you'd bring on or try to have, it would get ruined."
The show went off the air in 2010 and since then the cast members have gone on to settle down and start families, including Patridge who is expecting with fiance, professional BMX dirt bike rider Corey Bohan.
The TV personality said she doesn't believe "The Hills," which was on the air from 2006 to 2010, would have been successful were it aired now in the age of social media.
"I think if social media was a thing, The Hills would never be what it was," she told the publication. "Even now going to dinner [fans] sit there and take pictures and film, and like, listen. The secrets! There would be no secrets at The Hills anymore if there was social media back then!"
