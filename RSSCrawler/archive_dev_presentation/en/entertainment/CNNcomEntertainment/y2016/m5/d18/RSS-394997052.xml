<ExtractedText>Prince's bodyguard, "Romeo," tells CNN entertainer wasn't addicted to painkillers
Romeo called Prince's private memorial Sunday "beautiful"
Hopkins, Minnesota (CNN)
As details eke out about Prince's last days, the people closest to him have mostly kept away from the spotlight and kept quiet, until now.
Prince's bodyguard, who says he's been working for the megastar since 2012, spoke to CNN Sunday as he came out of an invite-only memorial for Prince. The service was held at the Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall where Prince worshiped in Hopkins, Minnesota, near Minnetonka.
A private service was held for Prince, Sunday, at his Jehovah's Witnesses church near Minnetonka, Minnesota.
"I was Prince's bodyguard up until the day he died," said Chris Gaither, who goes by the name "Romeo."
He is certainly built for the job. Gaither is a towering figure. Dressed in an electric blue suit, he was one of the last to leave the private memorial attended by a few hundred people.

"It was truly beautiful, fitting for someone as well known as Prince. We acknowledged his memory and his presence and everything that he's done for this world and for generations to come," Gaither said softly.

But his tone quickly changed when the question of Prince, painkillers and addiction came up. Gaither said he wanted to set the record straight and dispel "all the lies" out there.
"I packed this man's bag on the daily. I have been on tour with him for months. So if anybody had an addiction that would be something you would see. That would be something that you would know," he said.
Did he see anything at all that pointed to even a dependency? "No, no," Gaither said forcefully.
Bodyguard was in Texas when he got call
Gaither said Prince had sent him home to Texas for a week. It was something Prince would do when he wanted to rest. Gaither said he was helping out a friend when he received a phone call that shook him to his core. The person on the other end of the line told him Prince was dead. He says he found out just minutes before breaking news bulletins flashed around the world.
