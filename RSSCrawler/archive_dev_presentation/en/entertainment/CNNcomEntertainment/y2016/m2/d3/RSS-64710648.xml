Queen Latifah urged viewers to "do you"
Carol Burnett talked about trailblazing career
(CNN)
Saturday night's SAG Awards were unusual for an awards show. The brisk broadcast ran just over two hours and didn't play off a single winner.
Here are five of the top moments from the honors:
Don't mess with Queen Latifah.
The actress and singer, who won for the HBO biopic "Bessie," started her speech with a few arm curls of the heavy trophy and then paid tribute to the "Bessie" team.
But it was when she was wrapping up that her speech really sang.
Don't let others put you in a box, she told viewers.
"I hope that anyone out there who doesn't come in a package that anyone says you should," she said. "Knock that thing away and do you."
'Spotlight' takes top prize at SAG Awards
Double the Idris Elba.
Elba won two individual SAG Awards in a single night: a supporting actor trophy for the film "Beasts of No Nation" and a lead actor for TV movie or miniseries for "Luther."
He was dapper and understated both times.

"I really don't know what to say," he said after the second win. "Two wins in one night. That's incredible."
But Elba did get off the quip of the night when he was introducing "Beasts of No Nation."
"Welcome to diverse TV," he said, tweaking the race controversy surrounding the Oscars.
That's smooth enough for James Bond.
Speaking of diversity ...
Not only did the SAG Awards nominate a number of performers of color, a few took home prizes.
However, Viola Davis, who won best female actor in a drama series for her performance in "How to Get Away With Murder," put the focus on acting as a craft, noting that it was her job to create a well-rounded character, not a role model.
"Why do I have to be a hero? Why do you have to like me?" she said. "My job as an actor is to create a human being to the best of my ability.
"I get so much joy out of being an actor," she said. "It has been the joy, (the) pleasure of my life."
So glad to have this time with Carol Burnett.
The comic legend has won a number of awards, including a Kennedy Center Honor and a Mark Twain Award. But SAG's Life Achievement honor was something special.
Burnett recounted her childhood in the Hollywood area, where she and her grandmother would sometimes watch six or eight movies a week. Parodying those films on "The Carol Burnett Show" was a highlight of her career, she said.
But she was also proud to demonstrate that a woman could thrive as the host of a comedy-variety show. Network execs had told her it was a man's job, citing Sid Caesar, Jackie Gleason and Dean Martin. But Burnett's contract said she could do a variety show if she wanted to -- and she wanted to.
Thanks to her talent -- along with that of Harvey Korman, Tim Conway, Vicki Lawrence, Lyle Waggoner and a tremendous staff -- the show lasted for 11 years. She also became a hero to figures such as Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who introduced her.
"I'm so happy I pushed that button," Burnett said.
Who were you wearing?
Jewel tones dominated the red carpet. Kate Winslet wore green, as did Eva Longoria, Uzo Aduba and Burnett. Pinks and blues were also prominent.
But some celebrities got more notice for the look than the color. Burnett wore slippers on the red carpet, prompting one tweeter to say, "Comfort over fashion any day!"
Yes! #CarolBurnett rocks slippers on the #sagawards carpet - comfort over fashion any day! @KiSS925 pic.twitter.com/N66cwoyGLk
