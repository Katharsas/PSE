Taylor Swift lets loose during her award speech
A number from "Hamilton" dazzles the audience
Kendrick Lamar inspires awe and gets a standing ovation
(CNN)
Taylor Swift won the big prize. Kendrick Lamar was dramatic.
But on a night when Grammy watchers were expecting fireworks from that pair of big stars, they found competition from an unlikely source: the Founding Fathers.
Credit Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast of "Hamilton" for giving an uneven 58th Annual Grammy Awards one of its standout moments. Here are five things that dominated the show:
Taylor Swift lays it down

For most of the night, all people heard from Taylor Swift was the opening number, "Out of the Woods," and her cheer when Ed Sheeran won song of the year.
But her win for album of the year brought her to the podium -- and she let loose with a rousing speech.
"As the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame," she said. "But if you just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you're going, you'll look around and you will know that it was you and the people who love you who put you there. And that will be the greatest feeling in the world."
To whom could that speech possibly have been directed? Social media immediately seized on a certain furiously tweeting rapper who had proclaimed, "I made that b*tch famous."
I wish I could go back to 2009 and tell everyone, you know that Kanye and Taylor Swift thing you're all talking about? IT'S STILL HAPPENING
