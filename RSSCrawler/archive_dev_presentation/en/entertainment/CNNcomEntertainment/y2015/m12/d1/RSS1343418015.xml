Those colorful visuals, that ever-present Queen soundtrack ... 1980's "Flash Gordon" was supposed to be a blockbuster on par with "Star Wars." It wasn't quite that, but the campy film was quite successful in the UK and has gained a cult following. It's being celebrated on Saturday, November 28, at a special BAFTA event in London, with members of the cast (this new poster for the event is from superfan and comic book artist Alex Ross, who has compared it to "Guardians of the Galaxy"). But where have they been over the past 35 years?
