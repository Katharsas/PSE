Compared with other names on this list, the ones Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon picked -- Monroe and Moroccan -- are pretty tame. Hey, at least they're spelled correctly!

Jay-Z and Beyonc√© wanted a name so unique for their firstborn daughter that they even tried to trademark it : Blue Ivy.

We suppose magician Penn Jillette, seen here with his family and magic partner Teller in April 2013, really wanted magical names for his kids. His son's name, Zolten, is actually his wife, Emily's, maiden name, while his daughter's name is more creative: Moxie Crimefighter. "I love that it's a purely American word ... and I love that it stands for old-fashioned spunk and energy," Penn said in 2007.
