The big fish that started all the high-concept summer blockbuster insanity. In fact, until Jaws, summer was often viewed as a dumping ground (think August, these days) while winter was when studios debuted their hits. Partially due to a wide national release (as opposed to the then-traditional slow rollout of movies) and Universal's publicity blitz, Jaws opened with a $7 million take — the highest of the summer. It went on to rule the box office for 14 straight weeks, before Three Days of the Condor finally snapped the streak. It became the first film to top $100 million in U.S. box office and held the box-office record until Star Wars came along

There's not much more to say about Star Wars that hasn't already been said. It broke every box-office record in 1977. So, here's a fun angle: The movie had amazing legs. It was released in May, dominated for several weeks and then slid down the U.S. charts (The Deep and The Rescuers both claimed the top spot for a couple of weeks). However, in both its ninth and 15th week of release it reclaimed the top spot at the U.S. box office, including the week of Oct. 2, more than four months after its initial release. Future movies did bigger numbers but nothing held America's attention for as long as Star Wars.

Spielberg went back-to-back as box-office champ and cemented himself as the most successful director in the world with E.T. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. wasn't just a summer success, It was a global phenomenon that lasted all of 1982. It opened at No. 1 and stayed there, off and on, until December (it reclaimed the No. 1 spot in its 24th week of release and stayed there another week). Early in 1983, it surpassed Star Wars as the highest-grossing movie of all time.

George Lucas and Steven Spielberg came back in May 1984 with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, but their collective powers weren't enough to fend off a group of paranormal investigators who weren't afraid of no ghosts. Two weeks after Temple of Doom was released, Ghostbusters opened at No. 1 and stayed there for seven straight weeks until Prince came along and knocked it off with Purple Rain. While the sci-fi comedy owned the season, Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop edged it out for the year's highest gross.

'Beverly Hills Cop 2' – Released: May 20, 1987 Domestic Gross: $153,665,036 Foreign Gross:$146,300,000 Total Gross: $299,965,036

For the first time since the modern blockbuster era started, 1987 marked the first time that the summer box-office champion wasn't at least the top one or two highest-grossing movies of the year. Beverly Hills Cop 2 still had a great summer. It had the highest opening weekend of the year, and its $33 million debut crushed Rambo: First Blood Part II's record for highest-grossing R-rated movie ($25.1 million). However, the summer champ lagged just behind Three Men and a Baby and Fatal Attraction for the year.

The start of the summer belonged first to Twister and then to Tom Cruise and Mission: Impossible. Both were ultimately outdone by the patriotic actioner, Independence Day, which came along on Fourth of July weekend and appropriately had that weekend's highest gross of all time. It stayed at number one for two more weeks and ruled the rest of the summer... and in fact, the rest of the year, earning $60M more than its nearest competitor, Twister.

Starlord and Rocket Raccoon left Optimus Prime (Transformers: Age of Extinction), the Ninja Turtles (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), sentient apes wielding machine guns on horseback (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), and even fellow Marvel heroes Captain America (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and Spiderman (The Amazing Spider-Man 2) in their wake as Guardians of the Galaxy became the highest grossing film of the summer and got audiences everywhere hooked on a feeling. Ooga-chakka! Additionally, it's the only film on this list to pull it off by opening in August.
