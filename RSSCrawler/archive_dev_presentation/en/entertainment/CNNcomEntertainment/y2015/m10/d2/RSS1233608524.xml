The now-annual Batman Day falls on September 26 this year, celebrating all things Dark Knight with special events at bookstores, comic book shops and elsewhere. The character was created in 1939 by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, with his first appearance in "Detective Comics" No. 27. (DC Comics -- a Time Warner company, like CNN -- recently agreed to give Finger a co-creator credit).

Four years later, "Batman" first hit the big screen as a 15-chapter movie serial. It had a strong anti-Japanese sentiment -- with Batman and Robin fighting a Japanese spy during World War II, complete with racial slurs -- so it's far from politically correct when viewed today. Lewis Wilson and an age-appropriate 16-year-old Douglas Croft were the first actors to play  the Dynamic Duo, and the serial's portrayal of faithful butler Alfred influenced the comics. (As for Robin, he  was introduced in the comics in 1940.)

By 1949, Columbia Pictures' movie serial budget was cut to the bone, and it's apparent in the sequel "Batman and Robin." Robert Lowery and John Duncan took over the roles of the crimefighters, and this time Commissioner Gordon and Vicki Vale were added to the story, as well as a new villain, the masked Wizard.

By the 1950s, comic book sales had dropped, and there was an anti-comic book movement (which went all the way to the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency) that forced characters like Batman to fight space aliens and encounter ever-more outlandish plots (any actual violence involving human beings was forbidden). The characters Batwoman and Batgirl were introduced after psychiatrist Fredric Wertham said the book had an "atmosphere of homoeroticism."

As the story goes, Batman comic book sales were so bad that DC considered canceling them. Editor Julius Schwartz can be credited with saving Batman in 1964 when he rebooted the character with a "new look."
