"Seven" – The best movie twists are shocking enough to make you reconsider the entire film. (We'll reveal many of them in this gallery, so you've been warned: SPOILERS FOLLOW.) Kevin Spacey obviously likes twists, right up to his present-day role in the TV series "House of Cards." But he really made a name for himself in 1995's "Seven," despite being uncredited, as he was revealed as the serial killer setting up the Seven Deadly Sins murders that draw in two detectives, including Brad Pitt, right. David Fincher directed.

"The Usual Suspects" – "The Usual Suspects," the 1995 crime drama, was known for its twist ending involving Spacey's character, a disabled low-level crook who is suddenly revealed to be fearsome criminal mastermind Keyser Söze. "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist," he says.

"Psycho" – Some twists don't even take place at the end, giving the viewer that much more to chew on. Take Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho" (1960), in which star Janet Leigh's character is killed off in the shower less than halfway through the film -- never mind all the business with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his mother.

Director/writer M. Night Shyamalan is fond of twists and probably put them to best use in his first major film, 1999's "The Sixth Sense." Psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) hears Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) say he can see dead people, but Crowe doesn't realize that he's one of them -- until trying to talk to his wife near the end.

The difficulties of trust and identification in the Internet age are at the heart of 2010's "Catfish," the documentary about three filmmakers who travel to Michigan to meet a love interest, only to find out that the pretty single woman they thought they were talking to is actually a middle-aged mother with severely disabled children. The film, which spawned a popular MTV show, has itself been called a hoax.

"The Crying Game" – In "The Crying Game" (1992), an IRA soldier (Stephen Rea, right, with Forest Whitaker) falls in love with a prisoner's girlfriend. Or is that the prisoner's boyfriend? Jaye Davidson was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor for his gender-bending performance.

"Twelve Monkeys" – "Twelve Monkeys" (1995), with Bruce Willis, left, and Brad Pitt, is a tale of twisted time based on the French short "La Jetee." Willis, who has traveled back in time to stop a world-destroying virus, has dreams of a death in an airport. He finally realizes it's no dream; he was a child at the scene and saw his own death. The film was directed by Terry Gilliam.

"Planet of the Apes" – Five years earlier, Heston revealed another of the movies' great twists at the end of "Planet of the Apes" (1968). Believing he's traveled to an alien world populated by talking apes, it's only as the movie concludes -- with the Statue of Liberty emerging from a beach -- that he realizes he's on a future Earth. "You maniacs!" he screams. "You blew it up!" Rod Serling, of "Twilight Zone" fame, wrote the screenplay.

"The Third Man" – In one of the great reveals in movie history, black market profiteer Harry Lime (Orson Welles) emerges from the shadows in "The Third Man" (1949). For much of the movie, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) and the audience believe Lime is dead.

"Don't Look Now" – In 1973's "Don't Look Now," a troubled couple (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) travel to Venice to escape the grief caused by the death of their daughter. Sutherland's character has visions of seeing his child in a red coat, but it's actually a serial killer -- and Sutherland's visions are actually about himself. The haunting film was directed by Nicolas Roeg.

"The Wicker Man" – When the chaste detective played by Edward Woodward travels to a small island to investigate a missing child in 1973's "The Wicker Man," little does he realize he's about to become the sacrifice he thought he was looking into. Christopher Lee, who plays the island's leader, has said he believes "The Wicker Man" is "the best-scripted film I ever took part in." In the UK, it was seen on a double bill with "Don't Look Now."

"Fight Club" – Just who is the destructive Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt, left), and why does he keep tormenting Edward Norton's unnamed narrator in "Fight Club" (1999)? Well, there's a reason only Norton's character can see Durden: He exists only in the narrator's troubled mind.

"The Empire Strikes Back" – Some of the most startling words in movie history are uttered by Darth Vader to Luke Skywalker in 1980's "The Empire Strikes Back" ("Star Wars Episode V," for those who prefer the retitled version): "I am your father," Vader says. And thus the battle between the Rebels and the Empire becomes very personal.

"Saw" – For almost the entire running time of "Saw" (2004), a corpse lies in a pool of blood on the floor of well-hidden washroom. Meanwhile, two chained figures, played by Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell, realize they're part of a brutal serial killer's game. After much gore and misdirection, the serial killer is revealed to be the corpse -- who's not so dead after all.

"Diabolique" – The 1955 French film "Diabolique" remains a model for the psychological thriller. A wife and a mistress decide to murder their shared lover, a brutal schoolmaster. But when his body disappears, who's really controlling the plot? Turns out the real target was the wife. But the movie lets the audience wonder if she, too, is really dead.

"No Way Out" – Kevin Costner plays a naval officer investigating a murder in 1987's "No Way Out." The movie has a nice kicker in which Costner's character lapses into Russian, revealing him as the mole his character was supposedly searching for.

"Being There" – Chauncey Gardiner (Peter Sellers) appears to be a good-hearted but weak-minded gardener in 1979's "Being There." However, his simple nature leads him to high places, including -- it is suggested -- a possible run for president. As the movie ends, he blissfully walks on water, giving his character a holier level.

"The Cabin in the Woods" – "The Cabin in the Woods" (2012) is, like "Scream," as much a parody of horror movie cliches as it is a horror movie itself. But the final twist, including an uncredited performer, shows that underneath the parody is an apocalyptic heart.

"Chinatown" – Jack Nicholson's detective Jake Gittes knows that Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) has a twisted relationship with her creepy father, Noah Cross (John Huston), in 1974's "Chinatown." But he doesn't realize just how twisted until she reveals her daughter is also her sister , the product of an incestuous rape. "Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown," a colleague remarks as Gittes realizes how little he understands.

"The Parallax View" – "The Parallax View" (1974) neatly captured the paranoia of Watergate-era America. In the film, a reporter (Warren Beatty, left, with Hume Cronyn, center) turns up an assassination conspiracy, but instead of revealing it to the world, he ends up the target.

"House of Games" – Psychiatrist Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets sucked into an underworld of con men led by Mike (Joe Mantegna) in "House of Games" (1987). She thinks she's studying them, but as the old poker-table saying goes, if you don't know who the sucker is, you're the sucker. David Mamet, then Crouse's husband, wrote and directed.

"L.A. Confidential" – The modern film noir "L.A. Confidential" (1997) finds good cop Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) trying to battle corruption at the LAPD in the midst of a case involving celebrity lookalike call girls such as Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger). The corruption, it turns out, goes right up to the chief, played by James Cromwell, who kills a detective (Kevin Spacey) in a shocking scene midway through. Russell Crowe also stars.
