Jazz chanteuse Billie Holiday looks the picture of glamour in 1947 as she lounges in bed with a signature gardenia in her hair. Beside the bed is a photograph of Holiday and legendary jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong. Photographers for the jazz publication Metronome followed Holiday seemingly everywhere, even to her hospital bed, where this photo was snapped while she was recovering from an undisclosed illness. Limited Runs has teamed up with Getty Images to curate Metronome's photographs of some of the greatest figures in jazz history. The collection is now touring select U.S. cities.
