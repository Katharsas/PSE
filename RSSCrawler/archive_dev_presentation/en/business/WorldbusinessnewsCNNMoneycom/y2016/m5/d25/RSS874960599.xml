Google's European headquarters is in Ireland, which has one of the lowest rates of corporate tax in the Europe. British lawmakers have accused Google of funneling most of its European profits through there.
It's common practice for multinationals to base themselves in low tax countries, such as Ireland or Luxembourg. But the European Union wants to make it harder for companies to move profits around. It's planning new rules to force companies to pay taxes in the country where profit is made.

Google has agreed to pay £130 million ($185 million) in the U.K. to cover unpaid taxes since 2005, following an audit by British tax authorities. But many in Britain are still unhappy about the agreement, calling it a "sweetheart deal."
Media reports suggest Italy is also looking to retrieve hundreds of millions of euros they say Google did not pay in taxes.
Google is not the only U.S. corporation whose tax bill is under scrutiny in Europe. Public anger has been mounting for years as details have emerged of how multinational companies use complicated structures to dodge taxes in some countries.
Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ), Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ), Starbucks ( SBUX ), McDonald's ( MCD ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) have all faced a backlash over the amount of tax they pay.
