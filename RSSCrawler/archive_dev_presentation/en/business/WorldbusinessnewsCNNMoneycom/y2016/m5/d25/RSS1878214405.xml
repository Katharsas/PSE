<ExtractedText>Billionaire vows to crush Disney in China

China's richest man has global ambitions
One of China's richest men has vowed to crush Disney's big plans for its giant new resort in the country.
Wang Jianlin, a billionaire real estate and entertainment mogul, says his company is aiming to prevent Disney ( DIS ) from being profitable in China over the next 10 to 20 years.
Wang's massive Dalian Wanda Group is also in the theme park business, and he isn't welcoming the new $5 billion Disneyland that's set to open in Shanghai next month.
"Disney really shouldn't have come to China," Wang said on Chinese state television on Sunday. "It's financial prospects don't look so good to me."
He said Shanghai's climate doesn't suit an outdoor theme park, suggesting Disney will have to charge high ticket prices and risk losing customers.
A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment, saying Wang's remarks were "not worthy of a response." Disney CEO Bob Iger met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing two weeks ago.
