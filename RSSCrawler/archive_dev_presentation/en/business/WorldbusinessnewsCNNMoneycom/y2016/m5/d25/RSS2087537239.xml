The strikes are due to last until Friday, but the CGT, France's biggest labor union, said they could be extended if the government doesn't change its stance. And even if the blockades end, shortages are likely to continue for several days while refinery operations are restarted.
The dispute comes at a difficult time for France. Tourism has slumped following deadly terrorist attacks in Paris last year, and the economy is expected to grow by just 1% this year. The country is preparing to host the European soccer championship , which kicks off on June 10 in cities across France.
The blockades are already scaring big oil companies. Total ( TOT ), which operates five of the eight refineries, said it might revise its investment plans in France following the blockade.
The labor unions are protesting against changes in French labor law.
But there's no danger of France running out of petrol and diesel anytime soon. The French government said it still has 115 days of consumption in its fuel reserve.
