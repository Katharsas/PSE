<ExtractedText>Meet the entrepreneur helping Chinese people avoid names like 'Furry'
by Sophia Yan   @sophia_yan May 24, 2016: 10:40 PM ET
Washing Liquid, Twinkie, Purple Grape, Superman, Furry.
These are some of the offbeat English names that Chinese people have chosen for themselves, often not realizing that they may elicit smirks or baffled looks.
American entrepreneur Lindsay Jernigan is trying to change that with her website, BestEnglishName.com. For as little as 148 yuan ($22), she helps Chinese people select a more appropriate name. The 26-year-old came up with the idea while working in the Shanghai office of a real estate developer where her Chinese colleagues had names like Apple, Boat and Olilia.
"I noticed that Westerners would immediately marginalize them and not see them as real people -- people who were smart or capable," she said. "They would take them as a cartoon character and get really hung up on the name."
Jernigan investigated and found there were scarce resources for finding more appropriate Western names, even though naming is a tradition that's taken very seriously in China. A name is thought to make or break your luck.
BestEnglishName.com has an online questionnaire that generates suggestions for Chinese people.
She quit her job after setting up the naming service, betting it would become increasingly important as business ties multiply between China -- the world's second-largest economy -- and the West.
One customer, whose Chinese name is Shan Hongjun, sought Jernigan's help after noticing some Western colleagues struggled with his name.
Shan, 30, works for a major Chinese technology firm and wanted to find an English name that both Chinese and foreigners could pronounce without difficulty, making it easier to introduce himself at work or when traveling abroad.

In the end, it came down to Harrison and Carson. "I thought Carson might sound funny -- like 'son of a car,'" he said. "So I chose Harrison because the name reminded me of 'son of Harry,' and I think everyone must know Harry Potter."
Recent college graduate Yu Jiatong is improving her English to pursue work and study opportunities abroad. She felt she needed a foreign name to boost her chances. After consulting with BestEnglishName.com, she ended up going with "Alyssa" because she felt it was memorable and unique.
Since launching last year, Jernigan has helped more than 1,000 people choose names through one-on-one consultations. Another 40,000 people have filled out her online questionnaire that for a couple of dollars generates suggestions based on their responses.
Clients range from students looking to study abroad to parents who plan to give birth in the U.S. to gain American citizenship for their children. She's even done package deals for families.
