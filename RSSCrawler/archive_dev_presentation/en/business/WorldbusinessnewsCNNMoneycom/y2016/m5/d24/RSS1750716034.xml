<ExtractedText>2. Earnings and economics: Best Buy ( BBY ) and AutoZone ( AZO ) are among the key companies reporting earnings before the bell Tuesday.

3. Another auto recall: Shares in Toyota ( TM ) dropped 1.4% in Japan after the automaker said it would recall an additional 1.6 million vehicles in the U.S. due to airbag safety issues. This airbag issue affects tens of millions of cars with defective Takata parts.
Faulty airbags made by the company have exploded, firing out shards of metal that have caused injuries and deaths.
Shares in Takata ( TKTDY ) have dropped by about 75% since late last year as the airbag recall grows.
4. Beer merger: The European Commission could decide Tuesday whether to allow Anheuser-Busch InBev ( AHBIF ) to buy SABMiller ( SBMRY ) for about £68 billion ($99 billion).
The marriage of the King of Beers and the owner of Pilsner Urquell is dependent on the two companies selling off several brands to satisfy antitrust regulators.
If completed, it would be the biggest beer deal ever and among the largest acquisitions of all time.
