Tobacco kills around 6 million people each year -- more than 5 million smokers and more than 600,000 non-smokers who are exposed to smoke, according to the World Health Organization.
AXA warned that the situation is getting worse, with tobacco expected to kill 8 million people a year by 2030, mostly in developing countries. It added that unless action is taken to reverse the trend, tobacco will kill one billion people worldwide during the 21st century.
"As a major investor and a leading health insurer, the AXA Group wants to be part of the solution, and our hope is that others in our industry will do the same," said Thomas Buberl, Axa's deputy CEO.
AXA is not the first large investor to get out of tobacco, but most of the others that have made the move are linked to universities, such as Harvard and Stanford, or state pension funds.
And the decision to divest could be costly. Tobacco companies are doing well -- sales are steady and the companies often reward investors with huge dividends .
The MSCI World Tobacco Index, which tracks the biggest companies in the sector, gained 10% between January and the April, after rising by 18.6% in 2015.
"This decision has a cost for us, but the case for divestment is clear: the human cost of tobacco is tragic; its economic cost is huge," said Buberl.
