But investors are taking the hedge fund industry's playbook with a grain of salt these days.
Goldman Sachs says the average equity-focused hedge fund is down 4% this year. By comparison, an investor could blindly invest in an ETF tracking the S&amp;P 500 and still be up 0.4% in 2016. The recent struggles of the so-called "masters of the universe" have led many to conclude hedge funds will continue to slash their notoriously-high fees.
Here is the list of the top 20 stocks that Goldman Sachs says hedge funds are wagering the most amount of money against as of the end of the first quarter:
1.) Walt Disney: Size of negative bets: $4.3 billion; Stock performance: -5% in 2016
2.) ExxonMobil: $3.6 billion; +15%
3.) General Electric: $3.5 billion; -5%
4.) Boeing: $3.5 billion; -11%
5.) Netflix: $3.4 billion: -17%
6.) Express Scripts: $3.4 billion; -16%
7.) Target: $3.2 billion; -6%
8.) Caterpillar: $3.2 billion: +4%
9.) Chevron: $3.2 billion; +11%
10.) IBM: $3.1 billion; +7%
11.) AT&amp;T: $2.6 billion;; +11%
12.) Gilead Sciences: $2.5 billion; -17%
13.) Johnson &amp; Johnson: $2.5 billion; +9%
14.) Intel: $2.4 billion; -12%
15.) Walmart: 2.2 billion; +14%
16.) Ford: $2.1 billion; -7%
17.) United Technologies: $1.9 billion; +3%
18.) Oracle: $1.8 billion: +8%
19.) AutoZone: $1.8 billion; +1%
20.) Verizon: $1.6 billion: +7%
Note: Goldman Sachs did not rank these stocks based on the highest percentage of each company's shares being bet against, also known as "short interest." Instead, this list is based on the total value of short bets made against each stock.
