Home (2014) by Tayeba Begum Lipi – This two-channel video piece by Lipi shows the artist digging herself a grave on one channel, and a hijra called Anonnya telling the story of her life's struggles on the other.
Hijras have limited options to earn money, and many are forced into begging or prostitution. They most commonly earn money by singing at people's weddings or at children's births.

When the Life Began (2014) by Tayeba Begum Lipi – Lipi's installation When the Life Began (2014) shows the artist's childhood photographs juxtaposed against Anonnya's.
"I tried to make a connection between her life and mine," says Lipi.
Yet despite parallels in their early years their paths diverged with Anonnya being pushed to the edge of Bangladeshi society and Lipi remaining firmly within it.

Lullaby (2014) by Tayeba Begum Lipi – In a sound installation titled Lullaby (2014), Lipi created casts of her face and  Anonnya's face and placed them beside a headset. Visitors can listen to both of them singing a lullaby.
"There is nothing to distinguish her from Anonnya," says Caitlín Doherty, curator at the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum. "She is very much challenging the viewer about how we make judgments about [transgender] people."

I Wed Myself (2010) by Tayeba Begum Lipi – Lipi's video work I Wed Myself (2010) was inspired by friends unhappy in arranged marriages. In the piece, Lipi transforms into a bride in one video while she simultaneously assumes the guise of a male groom in a second video.
"I thought, 'What can you do to make sure you are happy? You marry yourself. The person you know best,'" she says.

Comfy Bikinis (2013) by Tayeba Begum Lipi – Lipi's Comfy Bikinis (2013) installation is made of safety pins. A recent exhibition in Dhaka showing an image of one of her bikinis on a banner was met with opposition.
"Some people came and they told the gallerist to remove it. They said it's a Muslim country ... These kind of small things are happening, but it could become a major problem," says Lipi.

The Nighty (2013) by Tayeba Begum Lipi – Exhibited at Art Basel Hong Kong earlier this year, Lipi's work The Nighty (2013) is also made of interlocking safety pins.
Safety pins are also significant in the context of Bangladesh.
"It's related to the female body. It's a very simple and small tool you always have in your bag to tie clothing. When I was a student and in a crowded place, you would use a safety pin in a crowd if men tried to touch your body," Lipi says.
