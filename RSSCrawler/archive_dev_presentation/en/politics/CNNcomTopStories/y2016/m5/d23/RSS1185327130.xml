<ExtractedText>100-foot slide
Royal Caribbean has added a bunch of bells and whistles to Harmony, the cruise line's 25th vessel.
One of the big ones: The Ultimate Abyss, which the cruise line calls "the tallest slide on the high seas."
Anyone who steps onto the slide will enjoy a 100-foot, 10-deck drop -- from the Pool and Sports Zone on Deck 16 to the Boardwalk all the way down on Deck 6.
"The reports back, and of course the top secret videos that we're seeing, are just literally thrilling," says Tamis.
Harmony of the Seas is the latest cruise ship to be crowned the world's biggest.
Harmony also includes a trio of water slides called Perfect Storm.
The attraction debuted on another Royal Caribbean ship, Liberty of the Seas, where Tamis says it's been a popular family draw.
"It's not only kids but it's parents and then it's even older people," he says.
"You get everyone there -- the older relatives watching the youngest and getting just as much thrill watching them as the kids are having to do the rides."
Greased Lightning
Harmony, like its fellow Oasis-class ships, is divided into seven "neighborhoods."
They include the Pool and Sports Zone (where Perfect Storm and the Ultimate Abyss live); The Boardwalk, which includes a carousel and the amphitheater-style AquaTheater; and a tree-lined Central Park filled with restaurants, including Jamie's Italian, a Royal Caribbean partnership with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.
For entertainment, the cruise line is offering a version of the musical "Grease."
Spoiler alert: The show features a full-sized Greased Lightning car.
"We don't do anything small," Tamis says.
Bionic Bar
This being a cruise ship, there are bars galore -- including Royal Caribbean's popular Bionic Bar, which is staffed by a pair of robot bartenders capable of mixing, shaking and stirring 1,000 drinks a day.
After its pre-inaugural sailing in England this weekend, Harmony will begin its official maiden cruise on May 29.
She'll spend the summer doing seven-night western Mediterranean sailings from Barcelona before shifting to the United States in November to make Caribbean runs out of Fort Lauderdale.
Prices start at $1,125 per person.
