<ExtractedText>MUST WATCH
'One China,' explained 02:20
The original Xinhua story has since been taken down, as well as copies posted on other Chinese news portals.
But the piece sparked a storm of criticism online, with users pointing to South Korean President Park Geun-hye and former Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi as successful, single Asian female politicians.
Li Yunlong, a professor at the Central Party School of Communist Party of China, voiced his anger on Weibo -- China's equivalent of Twitter.
"What does being single have to do with her political views ... isn't it naked discrimination against singleton? Chen Shui-bian (former Taiwan president) is married, but isn't he more extreme? Shouldn't there be a bottom line for political struggles?"
Others accused state media of being overly sexist and falling ill with " Straight Man Cancer " -- a popular Chinese term that refers to chauvinist, judgmental behavior that belittles women. 
MUST WATCH
China releases women's rights activists from detention 01:42
Under Chairman Mao Zedong, women famously "held up half the sky," but there is a growing sense that Chinese women today face more, not less, discrimination than in the past.
In 2015, The New York Times reported that women make up fewer than one in 10 board members at the country's top 300 companies.
And China's state-run media often appears more concerned with women's looks and  marital status  than equal rights.
The People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, published an  online gallery  last year entitled "Beauty with brains." It featured 18 snapshots of female journalists covering the NPC in Beijing.
And during the Lunar New Year holidays in 2015, a television gala watched by 690 million people  included comedy skits  mocking overweight and unmarried women. Incensed feminists called for an end to the annual televised extravaganza in an online petition.
Just weeks earlier, Zhou Guoping, an influential writer, enraged many when he said that "a man can have thousands of ambitions but a woman only one" -- to give birth.
