Ithaca, like much of the country, has been touched by a heroin epidemic
But this idyllic city has a very different idea bout how to address the problem
Ithaca, N.Y. (CNN)
Don't be fooled by the bucolic scenery or the leafy college campuses; Ithaca, New York has been rocked by the scourge of the heroin epidemic sweeping the United States.
Suffering from the drug epidemic isn't what sets Ithaca apart. It's how their mayor wants to deal with it that makes Ithaca unique.
The city is nestled along the southern shores of Lake Cayuga and consistently recognized as a great place to live in United States. Home to three colleges, it's one of the nation's "Smartest Cities" and boasts low rates of unemployment. But since 2005, eleven people here have died here from opioid overdoses. Seven of those occurred in the past two years. And in a one-month stretch this spring, four Ithaca residents lost their lives.
In response, Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick has proposed launching a program that has never been legally attempted in the United States: Giving addicts a clean and safe place in the city to use heroin in town.

"The first time I heard it, it sounded like we were just enabling people to do drugs," Myrick said in an interview with CNN in his downtown office. "But the truth is, in the places where it has worked, more people get off of drugs."
The first legal "supervised injection site" opened in Bern, Switzerland, in 1986, and others have since sprung up throughout Europe and in Australia and Canada. The facilities provide access to clean needles and other supplies involved in heroin use untainted by diseases like HIV and Hepatitis C. Users consume the drugs in the presence of a professional trained in treating overdoses, and others who can provide referrals and access to treatment programs. Supporters say this is a superior way to keep dirty needles out of the community and bring addicts out of the shadows.
The idea was just one of many that Ithaca's city government proposed as part of a municipal plan to combat drug abuse, the culmination of a two-year study that included participation from city leaders, social workers, drug policy reform experts, law enforcement, recovering addicts and focus groups involving members of the community.
Ithaca's movement on this issue comes at a time when policymakers are changing attitudes toward tackling drugs. Opioid overdose is the leading cause of unintentional death in the United States. The dire problem has prompted President Obama to expand federal treatment programs. In March the Senate passed a sweeping bill to address addiction problems and the House passed a slew of bills related to the issue in May. And it has played a significant role in both party's presidential nomination contests, with almost all candidates weighing in.
