WikiLeaks founder faces rape allegations in Sweden
(CNN)
A Swedish court on Wednesday upheld the arrest warrant of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, with a Swedish prosecutor saying there's still probable cause to prosecute him on a rape allegation and that "the risk of him evading justice is still large."
Assange's legal team immediately issued its own statement, saying it will appeal to a higher court.
While the legal back-and-forth continues, Assange apparently will remain in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which granted him political asylum in June 2012.
He's wanted in Sweden on rape allegations, and the United Kingdom arrested him in 2010. He has said he's afraid that if he leaves the embassy, he could end up being extradited and facing the death penalty in the United States over allegations of revealing government secrets through his site, WikiLeaks.
The statement from Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny said there's still probable cause against Assange on the rape charge as well as reason to believe he will flee to avoid prosecution. Prosecutors have asked Ecuador to let them question Assange at its embassy in London, Ny said.
