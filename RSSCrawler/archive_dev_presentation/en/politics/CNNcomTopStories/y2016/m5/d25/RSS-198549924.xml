Daughter of Hong Kong bookseller: Don't let China get away with illegal abductions

Angela Gui says her father, Gui Minhai, was abducted by China

He later reemerged in China to tearfully "confess" to a 2003 crime on state TV
Hong Kong (CNN)
The daughter of a Hong Kong-based bookseller and publisher whose disappearance caused international uproar says her father is being held without trial.
Angela Gui was testifying before the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China on Tuesday, about the alleged abduction of her father Gui Minhai from his home in Thailand.
Gui -- a Swedish passport holder -- was one of five booksellers who disappeared in late 2015. He reemerged months later in China to make an apparent confession on state television to a 2003 fatal hit and run incident.
Angela Gui testifies before the CECC.
"I didn't hear or see anything of my father until a clearly staged and badly put together confession video of him was aired on Chinese state TV," Angela Gui said.
"My father, a Swedish citizen who was abducted by Chinese state agents from a third sovereign country, is still in unofficial and illegal detention somewhere in China, without access to consular visits or legal representation."

Angela Gui urged the U.S. to pressure China for information on her father's case, and "to make sure that Chinese authorities are not allowed to carry out illegal operations on foreign soil."
"In the so-called confession my father says he traveled to China voluntarily — but if this is true, then why is there no record of him having left Thailand?" Gui said.
"Only a state agency, acting coercively and against both international and China's own law could achieve such a disappearance."
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request to comment on Angela Gui's allegations, but has previously denied abducting the men.
Disappearing booksellers
The disappearance of the five Hong Kong booksellers sparked mass protests, particularly after allegations that one of them, Lee Bo, was abducted by Chinese police , who are not allowed to operate in the partially self-governing city.
A British passport holder, the UK had said that Lee was "involuntary removed" from Hong Kong and the case was a "serious breach" of a bilateral treaty with China.
Lee later returned to Hong Kong where he told officials he'd been in mainland China to help with an investigation into Gui Minhai.
The other men also appear to be cooperating with Chinese authorities. However, supporters and some family members said the men's public statements were made under duress.
Beijing maintains that all the men -- including Lee and Gui -- handed themselves over voluntarily to Chinese authorities.

Lee Bo – Gui Minhai's business partner, Lee Bo was last seen on December 30 near his company's warehouse in Hong Kong. Hong Kong police have since confirmed he is in mainland China. Lee's disappearance sparked demonstrations in Hong Kong, where protestors believe his arrest was a violation of the former colony's autonomy. Lee and Gui's supporters say Mighty Current was working on a book about the love affairs of Chinese President Xi Jinping. UK authorities say they are "deeply concerned" about the possible detention of Lee, a British passport holder, and his colleagues.

Dong Guangping – A former Chinese police officer, Dong was arrested several times for participating in pro-democracy protests. He fled to Thailand with his family in 2015 seeking safety from Chinese authorities and a better life for his daughter, according to his wife Gu Shuhua. Despite UN recognition as a refugee, the Thai authorities arrested him in October for an immigration violation. Gu says her husband's immigration fine was paid by the Chinese government who then took him back to China. Since his arrest in Bangkok, she says her only contact with Dong has been seeing him in police custody on Chinese state television.
