<ExtractedText>India successfully tests first 'space shuttle'
Craft is a prototype of a re-usable launch vehicle
New Delhi, India (CNN)
It's one small step for India, but a potentially giant leap for cheaper space travel.
In the early hours of Monday morning, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) successfully launched its first "Re-usable Launch Vehicle," which at full-size will be able to lift satellites into orbit.
Scientists launched the unmanned model to a peak altitude of 65 km (40 miles) before turning it around for a controlled descent into the Bay of Bengal. The total flight lasted about 13 minutes.
"We are very excited," said Deviprasad Karnika, a spokesman for ISRO. "The team has been working on the project for the past 10 years, with the past five spent on designing the actual model."

But Karnik cautioned that there was a long road ahead.

"This is just an experiment, which is a baby step to the final reusable launch vehicle which will take years to realize," he told CNN a week prior to the launch.
There is no concrete next step for the team, but to analyze the data for now, he added.
