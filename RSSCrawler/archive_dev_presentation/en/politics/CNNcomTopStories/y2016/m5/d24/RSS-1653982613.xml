Belgium's understaffed prisons called 'apocalyptic'

Belgium's understaffed prisons spawn chaos 02:39
Story highlights
With guards on strike, some prisoners are being guarded by 10 people instead of 100
Critics warn that the strike makes it even easier to radicalize prisoners
Brussels, Belgium (CNN)
Still reeling from terrorist attacks, Belgium's prison system has become "apocalyptic."
So says Alain Onkelinx, vice president of the Wallonian parliament in Belgium's French-speaking region.
Prison guards in that region have been on strike for weeks, protesting what they say has been financial belt-tightening, the government's failure to replace retiring guards, and inflexible working hours that limit their ability to do social work with prisoners.
Onkelinx recently toured a prison with a colleague where 1,000 prisoners are being watched over by just 10 guards, rather than the usual 100.
"The waste's terrible. The odor. The smell. Terrible. Our visit -- shocking," he told CNN's Erin McLaughlin . "The situation is apocalyptic."

Prison guards stormed the Justice Ministry last week. One later admitted it was not the profession's finest moment.
Just two days earlier, last Tuesday, the Belgian capital was host to a scene seemingly out of place in a European capital -- let alone the unofficial European Union capital.
Striking prison guards, protesting what they deemed an unreasonable offer from the government, stormed the Justice Ministry, trashing the office in the process.
"Our culture of dialogue is being severely damaged," Justice Minister Koen Geens told CNN affiliate VTM afterwards. "Dialogue is always more important than violence."
Geens has laid out a master plan to replace failing prisons and bring on more personnel.
"International and national observers have reprimanded Belgium for years for an inhuman detention policy," he said in a statement. "And together with the government, I want to turn that page."
