<ExtractedText>WHO chief: Countries "dropped the ball" on mosquito control
Increased cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika evidence of a "dramatic resurgence" of infectious diseases
(CNN)
World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan lashed out at family planning and mosquito control "failures" as root causes of the ongoing Zika crisis in an address to the World Health Assembly Monday.
Chan said that countries "dropped the ball" on mosquito control in the 1970s and called the ending of effective control practices a "massive policy failure."
She said that abandoning policies that kept mosquito numbers down set the stage for a resurgence of a disease that had "slumbered" for six decades in Africa and Asia, only to "wake up on a new continent to cause a global health emergency."

Chan also said that family planning and sex education failures illustrated an "extreme consequence" of the disease, as causal links between the mosquito-borne virus and microcephaly, a condition which results in babies being born with severe brain abnormalities, become scientific consensus.
"The possibility that a mosquito bite during pregnancy could be linked to severe brain abnormalities in newborns alarmed the public and astonished scientists," she told the Assembly, the supreme decision-making body of the WHO, in Geneva.

In April, the WHO confirmed that the virus causes microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome, a condition which attacks nerve cells in the victim's nervous system and can lead to paralysis.
Latin American and the Caribbean have the highest proportion of unintended pregnancies globally, she said.
