Geisel Library, University of California, San Diego – For "This Brutal World" Chadwick, who started as an architecture blogger, sourced monochrome images from a variety of photographers to form his compendium. He says that black and white photography lends itself well to capturing Brutalist buildings, emphasizing the strong shapes it became known for.

Grand Central Water Tower, Johannesburg – The rapid development of concrete engineering in the mid-twentieth century allowed architects to craft increasingly outrageous designs for even the most perfunctory of buildings, such as the Grand Central Water tower, with its vertical cantilever structure.

Residential tower, Saint Petersburg – Warsaw resident Grospierre sourced many of his 200 Modernist buildings in Poland and the former Eastern Bloc. Many of the Brutalist works that feature were "large-scale housing estates done very cheaply," he says, a factor that has contributed to their poor condition today.

Salk Institute, La Jolla, California – Designed by Louis Khan, the Salk Institute is another example of large-scale public Brutalism. Commissioned by Dr Jonas Salk, the creator of the polio vaccine, and intended for use as a Biology department, Khan took the concrete boulevard and angled the blocks' windows to face the altogether softer sight of the Pacific Ocean.

Space Museum and Heliport, International Fairgrounds, Tripoli – Grospierre says he was drawn to Modern buildings partly because of their state of disrepair. They are "the embodiment of an idea of progress -- a certain type of progress -- abandoned over 30 years ago."

De Rotterdam, Rotterdam – Chadwick argues that Rem Koolhaas' De Rotterdam is another example of contemporary architecture riffing on aesthetics more than half a century old. In essence, he says a Brutalist building is one "avoiding unnecessary details... with a strong form and a lot of straight lines and faceless facades... It's bold, it's domineering; it's an indication that it's aesthetically different with it's surroundings."

Dead Sea Museum and Visitor Centre, Neve Zohar – The structure of "Modern Forms" is dictated by the buildings featured. Grospierre has curated a gradual blend, each building bearing similar properties to those around it, the effect reinforcing the ties that bind a global, century-spanning movement.

Tehran City Theatre, Tehran – Raw concrete, or "beton brut" found its way into many other Modern -- though not ostensibly Brutalist -- buildings, such as the columns of the Tehran City Theatre. The capital of Iran's most iconic building also draws upon concrete engineering: the Azadi Tower may be clad in marble, but underneath is tons of the stuff.

Institute of Scientific Research and Development, Kiev – Grospierre manages to sandwich obscure, UFO-shaped buildings such as the Institute of Scientific Research and Development in Kiev, between builds in Iran and Poland. The authors suggests imposing works such as the Institute must toe a certain line with their surrounding, saying "it's a question of weight [and] of the visual impact the work produces."

Sunset Chapel, Acapulco – Chadwick suggests Brutalist buildings have theatrical qualities to them -- perhaps why the style lends itself so well to public and ceremonial buildings, such as the Sunset Chapel in Mexico. A rectilinear boulder dropped among forest greenery, from the inside it makes maximum use of the stunning vistas around it.

Sanctuary of the Divine Mercy, Kalisz – Grospierre discovered similar concrete monoliths in Poland. He argues that whilst Modernism was underpinned by a "social program", Brutalism was "simply taking advantage of concrete technology" -- the type of technology that was able to create the vast curves and gravity-defying forms like those of the Sanctuary of the Divine Mercy.
