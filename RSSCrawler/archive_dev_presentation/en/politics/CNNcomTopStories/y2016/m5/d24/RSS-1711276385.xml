Gord Downie, the lead singer for the Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip, has terminal brain cancer.
Downie was diagnosed in December and "since then, obviously, he's endured a lot of difficult times," the band said on its website Tuesday morning.
For 30 years, Tragically Hip has been one of Canada's most successful acts, racking up 14 Juno awards and nine No. 1s. And the 52-year-old Downie is one of its most charismatic singers.
The band said it's planning a summer tour -- its way of dealing with the news.
"This feels like the right thing to do now, for Gord, and for all of us," the post said.

"What we in The Hip receive, each time we play together, is a connection; with each other; with music and it's magic; and during the shows, a special connection with all of you, our incredible fans.
"So, we're going to dig deep, and try to make this our best tour yet."
