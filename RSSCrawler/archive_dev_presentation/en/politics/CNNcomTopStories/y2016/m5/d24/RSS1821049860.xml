How it's made
Hu describes the process of creating clear wood in two steps: First, the lignin -- an organic substance found in vascular plants -- is chemically removed. This is the same step used in manufacturing pulp for paper. The lignin is responsible for the "yellow-ish" color of wood. 
A scientist from the study demonstrates the process of 'stripping' wood of its color
The second step is to inject the channels, or veins of the wood by filling it with an epoxy -- which can be thought of as strengthening agent, Hu says.
Epoxies are commonly used in adhesives and to reinforce composite materials used for building. The process, which takes approximately an hour, is done to maintain the makeup of cellulose nanofibers. 
"These tiny fibers that form the walls of channels, are what makes wood so robust," Hu explains.
"We don't disturb these channels -- and so for the first time, we can maintain the backbone structure of the wood, and make it transparent, while simultaneously making it stronger." 
After the color is removed, polymers or epoxies can be injected to strengthen the wood. The result is stronger, transparent wood
The advantages of 'see-through' wood
Implications from the research -- published in a report in the scientific journal Advanced Materials -- are wide-ranging.
In the immediate future, Hu sees its transparent capabilities as a substitute material to glass.
"Glass windows are a big problem in the summer and winter, they have bad thermal isolation," Hu explains. As a natural insulator, wood could better insulate from the cold and keep areas cool in hot weather.

The study also reveals that transparent wood composites exhibit high transmittance qualities or a "high optical haze" that could be potentially used in solar cells, which convert the sun's energy into electricity.
"If you place the transparent wood in front of a solar cell, the amount of light absorbed will be higher, and efficiency can increase up to 30%," says Hu, of the material's advanced ability to control and trap how light enters.
Stronger than steel
The material offers large-scale possibilities for architects and engineers, looking for greener building materials.
"Potentially, the wood could be made to match or even exceed the strength of steel per weight, with the added benefit that the wood would be lighter in weight," explains Hu.

Currently, Hu's team is seeking additional funding to expand their research, and predicts that transparent wood will be on the commercial market in a few years.
Since the research has gone public, Hu has already received numerous inquiries by firms looking to examine the technology for mass production.
