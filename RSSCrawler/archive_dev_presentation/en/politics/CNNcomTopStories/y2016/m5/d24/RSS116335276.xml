<ExtractedText>Ten people made up the crew.
Mohamed Said Shoukair
Mohamed Shoukair
Shoukair, the plane's pilot, had 6,275 flying hours under his belt. And his family hoped that career was only the beginning.
"He had ambitions and dreams," uncle Shehab Shoukair said. "We thought he would one day be a member of Parliament."
As mourners paid condolences to the pilot's family at a Cairo mosque Sunday, loved ones described the 36-year-old as the family comedian, a role model and someone who brought people together.
His last conversation with officials on the ground was described by Greek air traffic control as light-hearted.

"Everything for Mohamed, he liked to translate to a funny thing. He didn't like to complicate issues," the pilot's cousin, Sameh Shoukair, told CNN. "It's the type of life he liked to have."
But when it came to flying, he was serious.
Sameh Shoukair, a 51-year-old engineer, said he got teenage Mohamed his first laptop so he could install a flight simulator. From then on, he was hooked, his family said.
"He's a very well-trained, highly disciplined captain," EgyptAir Vice Chairman Ahmed Adel said shortly after Flight 804's disappearance.
The captain's flying experience included 2,101 hours on the A320 -- the aircraft model used for the flight.

His Facebook page says he'd been with EgyptAir since 2004 and lived in Cairo.
"He loved to be a pilot. It was a major part of his life," Sameh Shoukair said. "He loved to be in EgyptAir."
Days before the crash, the pilot bought a piece of land, where he planned to build a house. His cousin had been pushing him to get married and arranged a blind date for him the day of the crash.
"We saw him as our child," Sameh Shoukair said. "It's difficult to now talk about him as dead."
Authorities say it's too soon to tell what caused the crash. But Saied Shoukair, the pilot's father, had harsh words for whoever's responsible.
"Whoever took away my only son," he said, "may God take the light of their eyes."
Mohamed Mamdouh Ahmed Assem
Mohamed Mamdouh Assem
Assem, 24, is the first officer on EgyptAir Flight 804, according to an official close to the investigation and a security source. He lives in Cairo.
By Thursday evening, his Facebook account had been turned into a memorial page, and some of his friends had changed their profile picture to images of him. On Friday, friends and family gathered at a Cairo mosque to mourn him.
His uncles say he is a good man, engaged to be married soon, and are angry that some have implied the pilots were at fault considering plane came out of Paris.
Assem has 2,766 flying hours under his belt.
Mirvat Zakaria Zaki Mohamed
Mohamed is the purser, or head flight attendant of EgyptAir Flight 804, according to an official close to the investigation and a security source.
Samar Ezz Eddin Safwat Youssef
Youssef is a flight attendant aboard the flight, according to her family, and a newlywed married only six or seven months.
"She's always traveling," a relative named Mervat told CNN. "The last time we saw here was her wedding day."
Her aunt, Anwaar Mohsen, said she talked to Youssef on the phone this week. "She told me she was doing fine and was laughing.  I'm praying for her," Mohsen said.
Yara Hani Farag Tawfiq
Friends of 25-year-old Tawfiq, a flight attendant aboard EgyptAir 804, arrived at a service for her Saturday dressed in white rather than the traditional black.
"She never got to be a bride, so she is a bride now in heaven. This is not her funeral, it is her wedding for a whole afterlife of happiness," her friend of a decade, Sandy Makram, told CNN through tears.
The EgyptAir crew member of more than two years was described as a bright and bubbly women who loved her job and considered her colleagues to be family.
A portrait of Yara Hani Faraq Tawfiq  is seen during a memorial service.
"She is a sweetheart. We called her our baby friend because she had this childish spirit. She always wanted to fly. She was so imaginative," Makram told CNN.
At the Saint Mary and Saint Athanasius Church in Cairo, family members and loved ones were overcome with grief. Tafiq's mother was nearly inconsolable as she greeted dozens who came to pay their condolences.
"She loved going out. She loved her friends. She loved her family. She was very adventurous. She loved her work," Tawfiq's father said. "It is such a shock for everyone. She was young, she's never been married. But I accept this is God's faith."
"i just can't believe this. I don't even know what to say. I feel like I am in a dream," said Tawfiq's 18-year old cousin, Maryam.
"I will be a flight attendant like her," the young woman said with determination. "God wiling."
