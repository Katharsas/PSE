To use typescript (ts), you need to transpile it to javascript (the browser can only read javascript).
To use sass (scss), you need to transpile it to css (the browser can only read javascript).

Installation:
- Install Node.js and npm on your system (npm is usually included in Node).
- Check your installation by executing both "node" and "npm" on your command line.
- Make sure your node installation isnt outdated: "npm -v" should give you a version higher than 4.0.0 .
- Navigate command-line to project folder (which holds the package.json file).
- Execute "npm install", which will install all the needed dependencies into a new folder "./node_modules" (ignored by git).

Build:
- Navigate command-line to project folder.
- Execute "npm run gulp-ts" to transpile the ts source code to js (and scss).
- Execute "npm run gulp-watch" to automatically transpile the ts source code to js whenever you change a source file (and scss).

Files:
- Top level TS files must be specified in gulpfile.js. Other modules can be importet into these files. The file ending of the compiled file will be .bundle.js. E.g. foo.ts => foo.bundle.js
- Top level SCSS files must begin with an underscore. Other files can be included in these files. E.g. _foo.scss => foo.css
