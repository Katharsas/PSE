To use typescript (ts), you need to transpile it to javascript (the browser can only read javascript).

Installation:
- Install Node.js and npm on your system (npm is usually included in Node).
- Check your installation by executing both "node" and "npm" on your command line.
- Make sure your node installation isnt outdated: "npm -v" should give you a version higher than 4.0.0 .
- Navigate command-line to project folder (which holds the package.json file).
- Execute "npm install", which will install all the needed dependencies into a new folder "./node_modules" (ignored by git).

Build:
- Navigate command-line to project folder.
- Execute "npm run gulp-ts" to transpile the ts source code to js.
- Execute "npm run gulp-watch" to automatically transpile the ts source code to js whenever you change a source file.
